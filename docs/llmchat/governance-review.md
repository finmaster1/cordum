# LLM Chat Assistant — Governance Senior Review

Dogfooding QA for `cordum-llm-chat`: the chat copilot is itself a Cordum agent, so its tool calls MUST traverse the same policy / approval / audit pipeline as any other MCP client. This page records the senior-review evidence for the 13 governance probes specified in `task-931eaea2`.

> **Scope note:** task-931eaea2's plan calls for 13 probes covering identity, audit, gating, and tenancy. Several pre-execution findings (recorded in step-2 of the task plan) require corrections to the probe procedures before execution; see [Pre-execution findings](#pre-execution-findings) below.

## Status summary

Verdicts as of 2026-04-27 after the two filed P0s landed (`task-5b755f42` audit/query handler + `task-f13505cc` dashboard agent_id parity); the remaining gaps are operational (no deterministic LLM tool-call stub in the dev mock, no `cordumctl agent set-scope` CLI, shared-stack restart risk).

|              | Identity (1, 2, 7) | Audit (3, 4, 11) | Gating (5, 6, 12, 13) | Tenancy (8, 9, 10) |
| ------------ | ------------------ | ---------------- | --------------------- | ------------------ |

| Partial pass | 1 (probe 1)        | 1 (probe 4)      | 1 (probe 12)          | 1 (probe 9)        |
| Blocked      | 1 (probe 7)        | 1 (probe 3)      | 3 (probes 5, 6, 13)   | 2 (probes 8, 10)   |
| Deferred     | 0                  | 1 (probe 11)     | 0                     | 0                  |
| Fail         | 0                  | 0                | 0                     | 0                  |

Totals across all 13 probes: **1 PASS / 4 PARTIAL PASS / 7 BLOCKED / 1 DEFERRED / 0 FAIL**.

Audit-chain integrity (DoD #2): `/api/v1/audit/verify` → `status=ok`, `total_events=10000`, `verified_events=10000`, `gaps=[]`, `retention_window_hours=168`, `first_seq=1`, `last_seq=10000` (probe 4 evidence). **No chain breaks observed.**

Chain-verify p99 latency under chat load (DoD #3): **not measurable in this stack.** The chat-load backbone (probe 3 — 100 chat turns through real tool calls) is BLOCKED on the dev mock LLM; without that load source we cannot characterise the verify endpoint's p99 *under chat-induced load*. What we did measure on a 10K-event chain:

- Baseline serial verify: p99 ≈ 241 ms (5 calls: 199 / 206 / 215 / 222 / 241 ms).
- 20 concurrent verify calls: p50 = 1660 ms, p95 = 2325 ms, p99 = 2354 ms (overall wall-clock 2690 ms for 20 parallel).
- The verify endpoint re-hashes all 10K events on every call — its absolute latency is at the second scale, two orders of magnitude above the DoD's 10 ms-regression budget. The "≤ 10 ms regression under chat load" budget is unmeasurable until (a) a live chat-load generator exists *and* (b) verify is rebuilt for hot-path use (cached or partial verification).

`task-5b755f42` re-open verification removed F8 as a code blocker for the affected governance probes. Evidence from the fixed code path:

- `go test ./core/controlplane/gateway -run 'Test(OpenAPICoverage|RouteCoverage_AllRegisteredRoutesAppearInOpenAPI|HandleAuditQuery)' -count=3` → PASS.
- `go test ./core/controlplane/gateway/... -count=1` → PASS.

## Probe 1 — CAP SDK agent-identity round-trip

**Expected:** chat-assistant registers via `core/auth/delegation` + `cap/sdk/go/agent.go` on first boot (idempotent). On first boot, an audit event for the registration is emitted with `agent_id=chat-assistant@<tenant>`, `risk_tier=medium`, `preapproved_mutating_tools=[cordum_submit_job]`. On restart, no duplicate registration. Every subsequent tool call carries the CAP-tagged AgentIdentity in the audit record.

**Procedure (corrected per F4):**

1. `docker compose restart cordum-llm-chat` and capture timestamp `T0`.
2. `cordumctl audit query --type chat.bootstrap_registered --since T0 --limit 5` (or hit `/api/v1/audit/query?type=chat.bootstrap_registered&since=T0`).
3. Restart again at `T1`; query `/api/v1/audit/query?type=chat.bootstrap_registered&since=T1` → expect zero new events.
4. Drive a chat-driven `cordum_list_jobs` call; query `/api/v1/audit/query?type=mcp.tool_invocation&since=<call-time>` and assert the audit row carries `agent_id=chat-assistant@<tenant>` field.

**Actual (worker-e2a9, 2026-04-26T17:20Z):**

- (a) chat-assistant agent IS registered in `/api/v1/agents`: 1 entry (no duplicate ⇒ idempotent boot worked at least once across the stack lifetime), `id=d2315a95-7b08-40a1-8bdc-7b96858f41e6`, `risk_tier=medium` ✓ (matches plan spec), `owner=system`, `allowed_tools=20` (matches `config/llmchat/policy-default.yaml`), `preapproved_mutating_tools=['cordum_submit_job']` ✓ (matches epic rail #4).
- (b) Restart for idempotency check: `docker restart cordum-llm-chat-1` failed with `Error response from daemon: Cannot restart container cordum-llm-chat-1: error while creating mount source path '/run/desktop/mnt/host/d/Cordum/cordum-llm-debug/config/llmchat': mkdir /run/desktop/mnt/host/d/Cordum/cordum-llm-debug: file exists`. Environmental issue (orphan mount from another worker session); does NOT invalidate (a) but blocks fresh-boot test.
- (c) F8 follow-up: audit emission verification is no longer blocked by endpoint plumbing in the fixed code path. `/api/v1/audit/query` is registered and covered by OpenAPI route tests; RFC3339 `since` / `until` and `type=SIEMEvent.EventType` filtering are covered by gateway tests. Live re-run still requires deploying the fixed gateway binary.
- (d) Chain integrity: `GET /api/v1/audit/verify` → `{"status":"ok"}` (response is just `{status}`; no `valid`/`chain_depth`/`verified_count` fields).

**Verdict:** PARTIAL PASS for (a), BLOCKED on (b) by Docker mount issue. F8 is fixed at the gateway-contract layer; live audit-emission re-run is deployment-gated.
**Evidence:** Live API responses captured in step-4 worker note for the original failure. F8 fix evidence: gateway/OpenAPI/audit-query tests listed in [F8 follow-up verification](#f8-follow-up-verification-worker-7a6d-2026-04-26). Code refs: `core/audit/siem_actions.go:9` (constant exists), `core/llmchat/bootstrap.go:126,190` (boot + emission), `core/controlplane/gateway/handlers_audit_query.go` (query handler).
**P0/P1 task filed:** F8 filed and fixed as `task-5b755f42`; no new P0/P1 for the endpoint plumbing after the contract tests pass.

## Probe 2 — Chat-driven calls in dashboard Jobs + Audit pages

**Expected:** Open `/jobs` in tab A, chat widget in tab B; submit "$40 transfer in demo-mock-bank"; the job appears in `/jobs` with an `agent_id=chat-assistant@<tenant>` indicator and is clickable to a detail page showing full lineage.

**Procedure (updated by `task-f13505cc`):** Use a jobs response containing `actor_id=chat-assistant@tenant-default`. Open `/jobs`; verify the visible Agent column renders `chat-assistant` with tooltip/accessible label `chat-assistant@tenant-default`. Type `chat-assistant` in the Agent ID filter after both chat and workflow jobs are visible; verify only the chat-assistant job remains. Open the job detail page and verify the lineage banner says `Submitted by chat-assistant@tenant-default`. Audit visual parity remains covered by the Audit Log page's existing `agent_id` filter and tests.

**Actual (worker-e112, 2026-04-26):** F6 is fixed in `task-f13505cc` on commit `cbf50e60` plus the reopen fix. `JobsPage.tsx` now inserts a sortable Agent column after Origin, renders `actorId` as a truncated visible agent name with full tooltip/ARIA label, and flags `chat-assistant` / `chat-assistant@...` rows with a copilot badge. `JobFiltersBar.tsx` adds a debounced Agent ID filter backed by `?agentId=`; `JobsPage.tsx` filters the already-loaded rows when the typed filter changes. `JobDetailPage.tsx` shows a `Submitted by chat-assistant@tenant-default` banner for chat-assistant-submitted jobs and `Submitted by` metadata for all jobs.
**Verdict:** PASS for the F6 visual-parity blocker (Jobs table + detail lineage + Audit page agent filter coverage).
**Evidence:** `npx vitest run src/pages/JobsPage.agentid.test.tsx src/components/jobs/JobFiltersBar.test.tsx src/pages/JobDetailPage.parentbanner.test.tsx` exercises the visible Agent column, full tooltip/ARIA identity, no-actor fallback, copilot badge predicate, URL and typed Agent ID filtering, Agent sorting, and detail banner. `dashboard/src/pages/AuditLogPage.test.tsx` already covers `/policy/audit?...&agent_id=...` query construction for Audit page parity.
**P0/P1 task filed:** F6 fixed by `task-f13505cc`; no open P0/P1 remains for this probe's dashboard visual-parity blocker.

---

## Probe 3 — Every MCP call produces a `mcp.tool_invocation` SIEMEvent

**Expected:** Run 100 diverse chat messages covering all 22 MCP tools. Audit count of `mcp.tool_invocation` events grows by exactly 100. Zero drops.

**Procedure (corrected per F5):**

1. Capture baseline count: `before=$(curl -sk "$BASE/api/v1/audit/query?type=mcp.tool_invocation&limit=1" | jq '.total')`.
2. Drive 100 chat turns via the mockvllm script harness (phase-9 fixture).
3. Capture: `after=$(curl -sk "$BASE/api/v1/audit/query?type=mcp.tool_invocation&limit=1" | jq '.total')`.
4. Assert `after - before == 100`.

**Actual (worker-e2a9, 2026-04-26T17:25Z):** Originally BLOCKED hard by F8 — neither `/api/v1/audit/query` nor `/api/v1/audit/events` existed in the gateway.

**F8 follow-up (worker-7a6d, 2026-04-26):** Endpoint plumbing is fixed in code: route registration is covered by OpenAPI route tests, and `type=mcp.tool_invocation` filtering now matches `SIEMEvent.EventType` (with legacy `Action` fallback). The full 100-turn live chat run was not executed in this shared stack because the available governance probe scripts are placeholders and the dev mock LLM does not emit deterministic tool calls.
**Verdict:** F8 sub-check PASS; full probe remains BLOCKED on non-F8 live chat/tool-call harness availability.
**Evidence:** Historical live confirmation: `curl https://localhost:8081/api/v1/audit/query?type=mcp.tool_invocation → 404`. Fix evidence: `TestHandleAuditQuery_FiltersByEventType`, OpenAPI route coverage, and MCP package tests pass.
**P0/P1 task filed:** F8 fixed by `task-5b755f42`; remaining deterministic LLM harness gap is lower-severity follow-up from probes 5/6.

---

## Probe 4 — Chain integrity across chat-driven load

**Expected:** Run probe 3 + concurrent governance + security stress; `GET /api/v1/audit/verify` returns `status=ok`, no chain breaks. Document chain depth + verify p99 latency.

**Procedure:**

1. Start probe 3 in background.
2. Concurrently run integration_case_a + integration_case_b stress fixtures.
3. After completion, `curl -sk "$BASE/api/v1/audit/verify?tenant=default" | jq '.status, .valid'`.
4. Capture `time` of 3 successive verify calls; record p99.

**Actual (worker-e2a9, 2026-04-26T17:25Z):** PARTIAL PASS.

- Chain integrity: `status=ok, total_events=10000, verified_events=10000, gaps=[], retention_window_hours=168, first_seq=1, last_seq=10000`. Hash chain is intact across 10000 events.
- Baseline serial latency (5 calls): 199, 206, 215, 222, 241 ms — p99 ≈ 241ms.
- 20 concurrent calls: p50=1660ms, p95=2325ms, p99=2354ms (overall wall-clock 2690ms for 20 parallel).
- DoD #3 budget says "≤ p99 10ms regression" under chat load. The verify operation re-hashes 10K events on each call — absolute latency is 199-2354ms range; the 10ms regression budget is unmeasurable here without (a) a live chat-induced load generator, AND (b) a proper baseline-vs-load comparison harness. The verify endpoint's poor concurrency scaling (10× from baseline at 20 parallel) is itself a finding worth filing — verify is not designed for hot-path / load-test usage.
- F8 follow-up: the audit-query primitive needed by the probe-3 backbone now passes handler/OpenAPI/MCP contract tests; the chat-load component remains blocked on the live tool-call harness, not endpoint plumbing.

**Verdict:** PARTIAL PASS (chain integrity verified ok); regression-budget portion remains BLOCKED by missing live chat-load harness. F8 is fixed at the endpoint-contract layer.
**Evidence:** Live curl outputs in step-5 worker note. Verify endpoint's concurrency scaling characterized.
**P0/P1 task filed:** F8 fixed by `task-5b755f42`; still recommend P1 follow-up "audit-verify endpoint concurrency scaling — investigate whether re-hashing 10K events per call is the intended hot-path design".

`task-4102015f` follow-up: verify endpoint now coalesces concurrent identical calls via singleflight; new `cordum_audit_verify_*` metrics expose the regression budget. Re-run with the same 20-concurrent harness should show p99 within 1.5x single-call baseline.

---

## Probe 5 — Safety kernel actually gates

**Expected:** A chat-driven mutating call that fails the default policy (e.g. `cordum_update_policy_bundle` with a malformed bundle) returns canonical `-32099 approval_required` OR `-32000 policy_denied`; audit event has `decision=SafetyDeny` + the exact rule_id.

**Procedure:**

1. Craft chat message that maps to `cordum_update_policy_bundle` with bundle missing required patterns.
2. Capture MCP error code + audit row.

**Actual (worker-e2a9, 2026-04-26T17:25Z):** Originally BLOCKED on mock-LLM + F8.

- The dev stack runs a Python mock LLM (`docker-compose.dev.yml`) that always returns hardcoded `"Cordum dev mock LLM is healthy."` — it NEVER emits a tool_call request, so a chat user message cannot map to `cordum_update_policy_bundle`.
- F8 follow-up: audit readback is no longer a code blocker; the fixed handler supports `type=safety.decision` / `type=mcp.tool_*` event-type filtering and RFC3339 bounds.
- Workaround: bypass chat path and POST a malformed bundle directly to `/api/v1/policy/bundles` (admin endpoint) to test the policy validator. But that tests the policy validator, NOT the chat→MCP→safety-kernel pipeline that the probe is meant to exercise.

**Verdict:** BLOCKED on mock-LLM only; F8 endpoint-contract sub-check PASS.
**Evidence:** N/A.
**P0/P1 task filed:** F8 fixed by `task-5b755f42`; still recommend P2 follow-up "QA dev stack should ship a deterministic LLM stub that emits scripted tool_calls for governance probes".

---

## Probe 6 — Approval gate wire-through

**Expected:** Chat user says "approve job-abc"; `cordum_approve_job` fires; WS emits `approval_required` frame; programmatic accept; original call retries; `approval_granted` audit event chained to the original via trace_id.

**Procedure (corrected per F3):**

1. Pre-create pending approval ($200 mock-bank transfer).
2. Chat user requests approval; capture WS frame.
3. POST `/api/v1/approvals/{id}/approve` as admin.
4. Verify retry of original + audit chain via trace_id.

**Actual (worker-e2a9, 2026-04-26T17:25Z):** BLOCKED on mock-LLM (cannot emit `cordum_approve_job` from a chat turn).

- `cordumctl approval job <id> --approve` CLI does exist (verified F3, `cmd/cordumctl/main.go:192-227`); the API path also exists.
- The chat→approval-gate→retry loop test specifically requires the LLM to emit `cordum_approve_job` in response to "approve job-X" — the mock cannot.

**Verdict:** BLOCKED on mock-LLM.
**Evidence:** Static endpoint existence verified.
**P0/P1 task filed:** Same P2 follow-up as Probe 5 — deterministic-LLM stub for QA.

---

## Probe 7 — AgentIdentity AllowedTools enforcement (scope-first deny)

**Expected:** Narrow chat-assistant's AllowedTools to read-only; chat "submit a $40 transfer" returns scope-filter error BEFORE policy bundle; audit reason=`agent_identity_scope_deny`.

**Procedure (corrected per F1):**

1. Snapshot current AgentIdentity (`GET /api/v1/agents/<id>`).
2. Use the CAP SDK control-plane endpoint to set scope to read-only (no `cordum_submit_job`). See `core/llmchat/bootstrap.go:295-300` for the exact call shape.
3. Chat user requests submit; capture MCP error + audit row.
4. Restore scope.

**Actual (worker-e2a9, 2026-04-26T17:20Z):** Originally BLOCKED by F1 (no `cordumctl agent set-scope` CLI command) AND F8 (could not confirm audit reason via /audit/query). The static code path is correct (scope-first ordering verified at `core/mcp/registry.go:274,303`).

**F8 follow-up (worker-7a6d, 2026-04-26):** Audit readback is no longer a code blocker; the fixed handler can query by event type and RFC3339 bounds. Runtime scope-narrowing evidence still cannot be captured safely without a CLI/API workflow that does not mutate the shared chat-assistant scope for other workers.
**Verdict:** BLOCKED
**Evidence:** Order confirmed by code: scope filter at `core/mcp/registry.go:274` runs before approval gate at `core/mcp/registry.go:303`.
**P0/P1 task filed:** F8 fixed by `task-5b755f42`; F1 remains the blocking scope-mutation follow-up.

---

## Probe 8 — Data classification scope deny

**Expected:** chat-assistant tagged `[public, internal]`; a query touching `pii` (e.g. "list all users with emails") is scope-denied; audit records the attempt with classification=`pii`.

**Procedure:**

1. Confirm chat-assistant DataClassifications via `GET /api/v1/agents/<id>`.
2. Drive chat query that maps to a pii-classified tool.
3. Capture MCP error + audit row classification field.

**Actual (worker-e2a9, 2026-04-26T17:30Z):** BLOCKED on mock-LLM + F8.

- The chat-assistant agent record from `/api/v1/agents` does NOT include a `data_classifications` field in the JSON response (only id/name/description/owner/team/risk_tier/allowed_tools shown). The classification metadata may be set elsewhere (CAP scope) — needs separate verification.
- Driving a chat query that maps to a pii-classified tool requires real LLM (mock blocks).
- F8 follow-up: audit row capture is no longer blocked by missing endpoint code; the fixed handler supports event-type filtering. Runtime capture is still blocked by the mock LLM and missing classification metadata path.

**Verdict:** BLOCKED on mock-LLM + classification metadata not surfaced in /api/v1/agents response. F8 endpoint-contract sub-check PASS.
**Evidence:** Agent JSON shape verified — no `data_classifications` key.
**P0/P1 task filed:** F8 fixed by `task-5b755f42`; P2 follow-up to surface DataClassifications in /api/v1/agents API response.

---

## Probe 9 — Session-scoped delegation revocation

**Expected:** Close a chat session → JTI revoked in Redis → reusing the captured token on `/api/v1/jobs` (or another delegation-protected endpoint) returns 401 with `reason=delegation_revoked`.

**Procedure:**

1. Open chat session; capture JTI from session metadata (Redis `chat:session:{id}` HGET, or admin tool).
2. Close session via WS close frame.
3. Verify Redis `delegation:revoked:{jti}` key exists (`core/auth/delegation/revocation.go:14, 84`).
4. Reuse token on a write endpoint; expect 401 + `reason=delegation_revoked`.
5. **Adversarial extension (per step-10 self-review):** restart Redis after step 3, repeat step 4 — confirm revocation persists.

**Actual (worker-e2a9, 2026-04-26T17:30Z):** PARTIAL PASS by code-path verification, runtime BLOCKED.

- Static evidence: revocation API at `core/auth/delegation/revocation.go:47` `(s *RedisRevocationStore) Revoke(ctx, jti, expiresAt)`. Redis key pattern `delegation:revoked:{jti}` confirmed at `revocation.go:14, 84`.
- Runtime tests blocked: (i) Redis TLS client access from container fails with `Invalid CA Certificate File/Directory` (TLS cert path mismatch); (ii) opening + closing a chat session requires a WS client tied to the dashboard's session_id flow (out of scope without a browser/JS client); (iii) adversarial Redis restart in shared dev stack would disrupt other workers.

**Verdict:** PARTIAL PASS (static); runtime BLOCKED on env (Redis TLS) + shared-stack risk.
**Evidence:** Code refs above.
**P0/P1 task filed:** P2 doc — Redis TLS client path inside cordum-redis-1 needs operator-runbook clarity (the TLS files are referenced but the in-container path mapping is broken in this dev env).

---

## Probe 10 — Cross-tenant isolation

**Expected:** Open chat sessions as tenant-A user and tenant-B user; tenant-B "list jobs" does NOT return tenant-A's jobs; audit shows tenant-scoped filter.

**Procedure:**

1. `cordumctl tenant create A` and `B` (or use existing test tenants).
2. Open two chat sessions, one per tenant.
3. Tenant-A submits job-A; tenant-B asks "list jobs".
4. Assert tenant-B response does NOT contain job-A.
5. **Adversarial extension:** repeat with concurrent submit + list to test race.

**Actual (worker-e2a9, 2026-04-26T17:30Z):** BLOCKED on mock-LLM + tenant-fixture absence.

- `cordumctl tenant` subcommand existence not verified (likely via `cordumctl users` or organizations API). Step-7 plan assumed CLI shape; needs CLI inventory like F1.
- Driving "list jobs" via chat requires real LLM emitting `cordum_list_jobs` (mock blocks).
- The tenant-scoping code path itself is verified by gateway middleware at `core/controlplane/gateway/gateway.go:1498-1509` (tenant route prefixes including `/api/v1/jobs`); MCP scope filter for tenant likely at `core/mcp/registry.go` near the existing scope-filter call.

**Verdict:** BLOCKED on mock-LLM + tenant-CLI inventory gap.
**Evidence:** Tenant route prefixes confirmed in gateway.
**P0/P1 task filed:** Mock-LLM follow-up (P2); audit cordumctl for `tenant` subcommand existence (P2 doc).

---

## Probe 11 — Audit chain survives scheduler restart

**Expected:** Long-running chat session; mid-session `docker compose restart cordum-scheduler`; in-flight tool calls either complete OR get audit-logged with `reason=aborted`; chain integrity preserved.

**Procedure:**

1. Start mockvllm script with 5-second sleeps between turns.
2. After 30s, `docker compose restart cordum-scheduler`.
3. Wait for completion; verify all tool calls accounted for in audit (completed + aborted = total).
4. Run `/api/v1/audit/verify` → expect status=ok.

**Actual (worker-e2a9, 2026-04-26T17:25Z):** DEFERRED.

- F8 follow-up: the per-call audit visibility primitive is fixed in code (`/api/v1/audit/query` can list `mcp.tool_invocation` events by type/since). The destructive restart test still requires a dedicated stack running the fixed gateway binary.
- Restarting `cordum-scheduler-1` in the SHARED dev stack would disrupt other workers concurrently working on this stack (multiple parallel agents per the chat log). Cannot run the destructive part of this probe without a dedicated stack.
- Static prerequisite: chain integrity is verified intact (10000/10000 verified, no gaps) — see Probe 4 evidence.

**Verdict:** DEFERRED on shared-stack risk; F8 endpoint-contract sub-check PASS.
**Evidence:** F8 fix evidence from gateway/OpenAPI/MCP tests; would re-use Probe 4 verify output post-restart on a dedicated stack.
**P0/P1 task filed:** F8 fixed by `task-5b755f42`; still recommend dedicated test stack for destructive probes.

---

## Probe 12 — Policy bundle default enforced

**Expected:** `config/llmchat/policy-default.yaml` is loaded AND ENFORCED.

**Procedure (corrected per F7):**

1. Confirm file present at `config/llmchat/policy-default.yaml`.
2. Confirm chat-assistant AgentIdentity reflects the file's allow_tools (already verified in step-1: 20 allowed_tools match).
3. Drive a chat call to a tool NOT in `allow_tools` → expect scope-deny.
4. **Note:** the file is NOT auto-loaded into `/api/v1/policy/bundles`. Either (a) deploy step posts the file via `cordumctl policy bundle import`, OR (b) we depend on AgentIdentity scope to enforce. Both paths must be documented.

**Actual (worker-e2a9, 2026-04-26T17:25Z):** PARTIAL PASS by static evidence.

- File `config/llmchat/policy-default.yaml` IS present (verified step-1).
- chat-assistant AgentIdentity has exactly 20 allowed_tools matching the file: `cordum_approve_job, cordum_audit_query, cordum_audit_verify, cordum_cancel_job, cordum_get_job, cordum_get_run, cordum_list_agents, cordum_list_jobs, cordum_list_packs, cordum_list_pending_approvals, cordum_list_runs, cordum_list_topics, cordum_list_workers, cordum_list_workflows, cordum_query_policy, cordum_reject_job, cordum_run_timeline, cordum_status, cordum_submit_job, cordum_trigger_workflow`.
- Total MCP tools: 27. So 7 admin/destructive tools (e.g. `cordum_install_pack`, `cordum_uninstall_pack`, `cordum_update_policy_bundle`, `cordum_register_agent`, etc.) are deliberately NOT in chat-assistant's scope. The restricted subset IS the policy bundle being applied at the AgentIdentity layer.
- ACTIVE enforcement test (calling one of the 7 disallowed tools as chat-assistant and expecting scope-deny at runtime) is BLOCKED on mock-LLM (cannot drive chat→MCP calls via the mock backend).
- F7 partially mitigated: file content IS reflected in live AgentIdentity. The unanswered piece is whether the scope-filter at `core/mcp/registry.go:274` denies the 7 disallowed tools at runtime when chat-assistant attempts them.

**Verdict:** PARTIAL PASS (file present + scope is restricted subset = passive evidence of loading); active enforcement BLOCKED on mock-LLM.
**Evidence:** Live `/api/v1/agents` query shows curated 20-of-27 scope.
**P0/P1 task filed:** F7 (P1) reframe; mock-LLM follow-up (P2).

---

## Probe 13 — Zero-trust verification (defense in depth)

**Expected:** Even if AgentIdentity scoping is misconfigured, safety kernel is the last line and denies unauthorized mutations.

**Procedure (corrected per F1):**

1. Use CAP SDK to set chat-assistant AllowedTools to wildcard (or remove constraints).
2. Drive an unauthorized mutation (e.g. `cordum_uninstall_pack`).
3. Confirm SAFETY KERNEL still denies via policy bundle (audit row decision=SafetyDeny).
4. Restore AgentIdentity scope.

**Actual (worker-e2a9, 2026-04-26T17:25Z):** BLOCKED.

- F1: no `cordumctl agent set-scope`. The CAP SDK control-plane endpoint at `bootstrap.go:295-300` could be used directly via API, but doing so on the live shared dev stack would corrupt the chat-assistant scope for other workers.
- Mock-LLM blocks driving the unauthorized mutation through the chat path.
- F8 follow-up: reading back the SafetyDeny audit row is no longer blocked by missing endpoint code; runtime remains blocked by F1, mock-LLM, and shared-stack safety.

**Verdict:** BLOCKED on F1 + mock-LLM + shared-stack risk. F8 endpoint-contract sub-check PASS.
**Evidence:** N/A.
**P0/P1 task filed:** F1 (P1), mock-LLM follow-up (P2). F8 fixed by `task-5b755f42`; shared-stack risk recommends dedicated test env.

## Adversarial self-review (step-10)

Walked 2026-04-27 by worker-ef86, reading the documented probe outcomes as a hostile reviewer rather than the author. Each of the 9 checks below is either a documented PASS, a fix applied in this round, or an explicit follow-up procedure that must run when the underlying probe is unblocked.

| # | Hostile check | Status | Notes |
| - | ------------- | ------ | ----- |
| 1 | Probe 7: scope-narrowing applied atomically — no TOCTOU window where the chat could submit a mutating call between the read of the old scope and the write of the new one. | DEFERRED to first probe-7 live run. | Probe 7 itself was BLOCKED in this session (F1 + shared-stack risk). The atomicity of `SetScope` is a separate property of `cap/sdk/go/agent.go` — `PUT /api/v1/agents/{id}` accepts an `Idempotency-Key` header but the gateway does NOT serialise concurrent SetScope calls today, so a TOCTOU window is theoretically possible if two operators narrow scope concurrently. **Procedure addition for the live re-run:** before issuing SetScope, capture `scope_revision` (from GET); after SetScope, GET again and assert `revision = revision_before + 1` and the response reflects the narrowed AllowedTools. Only after that confirmation should the chat-driven submit be issued. Filed as a procedure note, not a P0 — narrowing scope is an admin-only path, not chat-driven, so the practical TOCTOU surface is small. |
| 2 | Probe 9: revocation persists across Redis restart (durability), not just in-memory. | FIX APPLIED to procedure. | Probe 9 procedure now includes an adversarial extension: `docker compose restart redis` after the Revoke succeeds, then retry the captured token on a write endpoint and confirm 401 still. Verified statically: `delegation:revoked:{jti}` is a normal Redis key (not in-memory only); persistence depends on Redis RDB/AOF config in `core/infra/store`. Filed as **P2**: confirm `cordum-redis-1` is configured with `appendonly yes` (AOF) so revocations survive even between RDB snapshots. |
| 3 | Probe 10: cross-tenant isolation HOLDS under concurrent submit + list race. | DEFERRED to first probe-10 live run. | Probe 10 was BLOCKED on mock-LLM + tenant-fixture absence. **Procedure addition for the live re-run:** spawn two goroutines / shells — tenant-A submits in a tight 50× loop while tenant-B simultaneously polls `cordum_list_jobs` 50×. Assert tenant-B never observes any tenant-A job_id. The static reasoning argues this is safe (tenant_id is in the request JWT, no shared mutable state), but a race condition in shared cache or a query that forgets to filter would only show under contention. |
| 4 | Probe 4: audit-verify ran AFTER buffer flush (audit buffer is async; allow 5s). | PASS. | Probe-4 evidence was captured against a stack that had been running with 10K events accumulated for hours — the async audit buffer (`core/audit/buffer.go`) had long since flushed every event. **Procedure addition** for any future probe that runs verify immediately after generating events: insert a 5s sleep before verify, and re-issue verify three times to detect any sequence gap that closes within the flush interval. |
| 5 | Probe 13: confirmed safety kernel denies (vs. scope filter denying first). | DEFERRED to first probe-13 live run. | Procedure already requires setting AllowedTools to wildcard so scope filter passes; assertion must read `decision=SafetyDeny` from the audit row (not `agent_identity_scope_deny`). **Procedure addition:** assert audit row carries `safety_rule_id=<actual-rule>` and is tied to the same `trace_id` as the chat tool call — otherwise we cannot prove the deny came from the safety kernel and not from a different gate. |
| 6 | Probe 11: in-flight delegation tokens preserved across scheduler restart, or invalidated. | DEFERRED to first probe-11 live run. | Delegation tokens live in Redis (`core/auth/delegation/`), not in scheduler memory, so scheduler restart should not invalidate them. **Procedure addition:** the probe-11 reproducer should explicitly capture a delegation JWT before the restart, attempt to use it after the restart, and document whether the JTI is still valid (expected: yes; unexpected: scheduler caches token validation in-memory and the cache empties on restart). |
| 7 | Residual state cleaned (test agents, test tenants, test sessions). | PASS. | Step-9 (docs + cross-link) made no runtime mutations. Earlier sessions (steps 4-7) did not successfully mutate AgentIdentity scope (probe 7 / 13 blocked), did not create test tenants (probe 10 blocked), and did not open + leave open chat sessions (mock-LLM blocked). The single environmental residual is the orphan Docker mount at `/run/desktop/mnt/host/d/Cordum/cordum-llm-debug/` that prevented `cordum-llm-chat-1` restart during probe 1(b); that mount predates this task and is **not** a residual of this work. |
| 8 | No real PII / API keys / tenant data leaked into evidence files. | PASS. | Grep confirms `governance-review.md` and `cap/docs/agent-registration.md` do not contain `Authorization: Bearer <real-token>`, `X-API-Key: <real-key>`, real customer names, or real PII. The chat-assistant UUID `d2315a95-7b08-40a1-8bdc-7b96858f41e6` is a dev-stack generated identifier, not sensitive. Tenant references throughout the doc are placeholders (`tenant-default`, `tenant-A`, `tenant-B`). |
| 9 | Any temporary scope override fully reverted. | PASS. | No scope overrides were applied in this session — probes 7 and 13 were both BLOCKED before any mutating call. There is nothing to revert. The plan's hypothetical `LLMCHAT_DISABLE_SCOPE_CHECK` env var was never introduced (no such flag exists in the codebase per step-2 finding) and was never set. |

**Step-10 outcome:** 4 PASS (checks 4, 7, 8, 9), 1 fix-applied-to-procedure (check 2 — Redis restart durability extension + new P2 to confirm `cordum-redis-1` AOF mode), 4 DEFERRED-to-live-run procedure additions (checks 1, 3, 5, 6). No probe needs a re-run *for the adversarial check itself* in this session because most probes are still BLOCKED at the operational layer (mock-LLM, F1 CLI, shared-stack restart risk).
