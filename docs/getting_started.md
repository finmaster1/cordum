# Getting Started

This guide gets a local Cordum stack running with the default Docker compose
setup.

## Prerequisites

- Docker + Docker Compose
- curl
- jq

## Start the stack

```bash
docker compose build
docker compose up -d
```

The API gateway listens on `http://localhost:8081` by default.

## Set an API key

Compose uses a default API key of `[REDACTED]`. To override:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# edit CORDUM_API_KEY
```

## Run a workflow smoke test

```bash
./tools/scripts/platform_smoke.sh
```

Expected output:
- workflow created
- run started
- approval step approved
- run completes
- workflow + run deleted

## Use the CLI

```bash
./tools/scripts/cordumctl_smoke.sh
```

## Open the dashboard (optional)

```text
http://localhost:8082
```

## Reset local state

```bash
docker compose exec redis redis-cli FLUSHALL
```

To wipe JetStream state too:

```bash
docker compose down -v
```
