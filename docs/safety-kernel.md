# Safety Kernel Reference

This document describes Safety Kernel behavior from code in:

- `core/controlplane/safetykernel/kernel.go`
- `core/controlplane/safetykernel/output_policy.go`
- `core/controlplane/safetykernel/scanners.go`
- `core/infra/config/safety_policy.go`
- `core/controlplane/scheduler/safety_client.go`
- `core/controlplane/gateway/gateway_jobs.go`

## 1. Overview

Safety Kernel is the policy decision point for Cordum:

- Input policy is evaluated before scheduler dispatch.
- Output policy is evaluated through `OutputPolicyService.CheckOutput`.
- Policy can be sourced from file or URL, merged with config-service fragments, and hot-reloaded.

The scheduler treats Safety Kernel as part of the hot path and uses short client timeouts (`2s`) plus a circuit breaker to protect throughput.

## 2. Input Policy Rules

Input rule model is defined in `core/infra/config/safety_policy.go` under `rules[]`.

Rule matching supports:

- `tenants`
- `topics` (glob match via `path.Match`, for example `job.*`)
- `capabilities`
- `risk_tags`
- `requires` (all required entries must be present)
- `pack_ids`
- `actor_ids`
- `actor_types`
- `labels`
- `secrets_present`
- `mcp` (server/tool/resource/action)

Decisions are normalized to:

- `allow`
- `deny`
- `require_approval`
- `throttle`
- `allow_with_constraints`

If constraints are present, response can be `ALLOW_WITH_CONSTRAINTS` even when decision is `allow`.

Approval binding behavior:

- `approval_required` is true for `require_approval`.
- `approval_ref` is set to the incoming `job_id`.

## 3. MCP Label Filtering

MCP request context is extracted from job labels:

- `mcp.server` | `mcp_server` | `mcpServer`
- `mcp.tool` | `mcp_tool` | `mcpTool`
- `mcp.resource` | `mcp_resource` | `mcpResource`
- `mcp.action` | `mcp_action` | `mcpAction` (normalized to lowercase)

MCP policy fields:

- `allow_servers`, `deny_servers`
- `allow_tools`, `deny_tools`
- `allow_resources`, `deny_resources`
- `allow_actions`, `deny_actions`

Evaluation order:

1. Rule-level `match.mcp` (if present)
2. Tenant-level `tenants.<tenant>.mcp`
3. Effective runtime safety overlay (`CORDUM_EFFECTIVE_CONFIG` -> `safety.mcp`)

Within each MCP field, deny takes precedence:

1. If value is in deny list -> deny
2. Else if allow list is non-empty and value is not in allow list -> deny
3. Else -> allow

MCP list matching is case-insensitive exact match. Topic matching supports glob patterns; MCP fields do not currently use glob pattern matching.

Example:

```yaml
tenants:
  default:
    mcp:
      allow_servers: ["github", "jira"]
      deny_servers: ["internal-admin"]
      allow_tools: ["search_issues", "get_issue"]
      deny_tools: ["delete_issue"]
      allow_resources: []
      deny_resources: ["repo://secret/*"]
      allow_actions: ["read", "list"]
      deny_actions: ["write", "delete"]
```

## 4. Policy Overlay System

Policy source selection:

- `SAFETY_POLICY_URL` (if set) overrides `SAFETY_POLICY_PATH`.
- If neither is set, loader can still use config-service fragments.

Config-service fragment loading:

- Controlled by:
  - `SAFETY_POLICY_CONFIG_SCOPE` (default `system`)
  - `SAFETY_POLICY_CONFIG_ID` (default `policy`)
  - `SAFETY_POLICY_CONFIG_KEY` (default `bundles`)
  - `SAFETY_POLICY_CONFIG_DISABLE` (disable fragment loading when set)
- Fragments are loaded from config service, sorted by key, and merged deterministically.
- Fragment entries may include `enabled: false` and are skipped when disabled.

Merge order:

```text
base policy (file/url)
  -> config-service fragments (enabled bundles)
    -> request effective config restrictions (topics + MCP) at evaluation time
```

Reload behavior:

- Watch interval defaults to `30s`.
- Override with `SAFETY_POLICY_RELOAD_INTERVAL` (duration string, for example `10s`, `1m`).
- When snapshot changes, in-memory policy is replaced and recent snapshots are tracked.

## 5. Decision Cache

Safety decision cache is controlled by:

- `SAFETY_DECISION_CACHE_TTL`
- `SAFETY_DECISION_CACHE_MAX_SIZE` (default `10000`)

Cache key:

- Deterministic protobuf marshal of `PolicyCheckRequest`
- `job_id` cleared before hashing (enables reuse across different jobs with same policy-relevant input)
- Snapshot-prefixed key: `<snapshot>:<sha256(request)>`

Cache semantics:

- Cached responses omit `approval_ref` at rest.
- On cache hit, `approval_ref` is re-bound to current `job_id` when approval is required.
- Eviction first removes expired entries, then evicts the entry closest to expiration when still over capacity.

Reload invalidation:

- Snapshot is part of the key, so policy reload naturally causes misses against old snapshot keys.
- Additionally, a `policyVersion` counter (atomic uint64) tags every cache entry with the version active when it was created.
- When `setPolicy()` is called, the version counter increments and the entire cache is cleared immediately.
- On cache lookup, if the entry's `policyVersion` does not match the current version, the entry is treated as a miss and deleted — this is a belt-and-suspenders guard in addition to the cache clear.
- In multi-replica deployments, each replica independently invalidates its cache when it receives the policy update (e.g., via NATS config notification or file watcher). No Redis is involved — cache management is purely local per-replica.

## 6. Policy Signature Verification (Ed25519)

Verification inputs:

- `SAFETY_POLICY_PUBLIC_KEY` (base64 or hex raw Ed25519 public key, 32 bytes)
- Signature from one of:
  - `SAFETY_POLICY_SIGNATURE` (base64 or hex)
  - `SAFETY_POLICY_SIGNATURE_PATH` (raw signature bytes)
  - `<policy-file>.sig` fallback for file-based policy source

When signature is required:

- Always in production (`CORDUM_ENV=production` or `CORDUM_PRODUCTION=true`)
- Or when `SAFETY_POLICY_SIGNATURE_REQUIRED=true`

Failure conditions include missing public key, invalid key/signature length, or verification failure.

Minimal signing flow (Go):

```go
// sign_policy.go
// go run sign_policy.go policy.yaml private.key > policy.sig.b64
package main

import (
	"crypto/ed25519"
	"encoding/base64"
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	policy, _ := os.ReadFile(os.Args[1])
	priv, _ := os.ReadFile(os.Args[2]) // raw 64-byte ed25519 private key
	sig := ed25519.Sign(ed25519.PrivateKey(priv), policy)
	fmt.Println(base64.StdEncoding.EncodeToString(sig))
}
```

Key rotation procedure:

1. Generate a new keypair and distribute the new public key.
2. Re-sign active policy bundles with the new private key.
3. Roll `SAFETY_POLICY_PUBLIC_KEY` and signature together.
4. Keep old key only for rollback window; remove after cutover validation.

## 7. Remediations

Policy rules can return remediations:

- `id`
- `title`
- `summary`
- `replacement_topic`
- `replacement_capability`
- `add_labels`
- `remove_labels`

Remediations are returned in `PolicyCheckResponse.remediations` and persisted with job safety records.

Apply remediation endpoint:

- `POST /api/v1/jobs/{id}/remediate`
- Requires `admin` role and tenant access
- Request body: `{"remediation_id":"<id>"}` (required when multiple remediations exist)

Replacement semantics in gateway:

- New job is cloned from original request.
- `replacement_topic` overrides `topic` if provided.
- `replacement_capability` overrides `meta.capability` if provided.
- Labels are rewritten:
  - add `remediation_of` and `remediation_id`
  - apply `add_labels`
  - remove `remove_labels`

## 8. gRPC Services and TLS

Safety Kernel server implements:

- `SafetyKernelServer`
  - `Check()`
  - `Evaluate()`
  - `Explain()`
  - `Simulate()`
  - `ListSnapshots()`
- `OutputPolicyServiceServer`
  - `CheckOutput()`

`Check/Evaluate/Explain/Simulate` share the same evaluation path (`evaluate(...)` in `kernel.go`).

TLS for Safety Kernel server:

- `SAFETY_KERNEL_TLS_CERT`
- `SAFETY_KERNEL_TLS_KEY`
- Production requires server TLS cert/key.
- Minimum TLS version is controlled by `CORDUM_TLS_MIN_VERSION` (defaults to TLS 1.3 in production, TLS 1.2 otherwise).

TLS for clients (scheduler/gateway dialing Safety Kernel):

- `SAFETY_KERNEL_TLS_CA`
- `SAFETY_KERNEL_TLS_REQUIRED`
- `SAFETY_KERNEL_INSECURE` (for non-production/testing)

## 9. Scheduler Circuit Breaker (Safety Client)

Scheduler safety client circuit states:

```text
CLOSED --(3 failures)--> OPEN --(30s elapsed)--> HALF_OPEN
HALF_OPEN --(2 successes)--> CLOSED
HALF_OPEN --(failure)------> OPEN
```

Constants (`core/controlplane/scheduler/safety_client.go`):

- Request timeout: `2s`
- Open duration: `30s`
- Fail budget to open: `3`
- Half-open max probe requests: `3`
- Half-open successes to close: `2`

When open/half-open-throttled, scheduler receives `SafetyUnavailable` decisions instead of blocking on RPC.

## 10. Input Policy Fail Mode

When the safety kernel is unreachable during pre-dispatch policy checks, the scheduler's behavior is controlled by the `POLICY_CHECK_FAIL_MODE` setting:

| Mode | Behavior | Risk |
|------|----------|------|
| `closed` (default) | Job is requeued with exponential backoff until the safety kernel recovers | No unsafe jobs pass through; availability impact during outages |
| `open` | Job is allowed through with a warning log and metric increment | Jobs bypass safety checks; use only when availability is prioritized over safety |

**Risk implications of fail-open**: In `open` mode, jobs that would normally be denied or require approval are allowed through without evaluation. This should only be used in environments where safety violations are tolerable (e.g., staging) or where compensating controls exist downstream. Production deployments should use the default `closed` mode.

**Configuration**:
- Environment variable: `POLICY_CHECK_FAIL_MODE` (values: `closed`, `open`)
- Config file: `config/safety.yaml` under `input_policy.fail_mode`

**Prometheus metric**: `cordum_scheduler_input_fail_open_total` (counter, labels: `topic`) — incremented each time a job is allowed through under fail-open mode. Alert on this metric to detect safety kernel outages that are silently bypassing policy checks.
