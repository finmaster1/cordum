- Step dependencies visualized as a directed acyclic graph (DAG)
- Run list with status badges and timing
- Trigger new run or edit workflow

#### Run Detail (`/workflows/:id/runs/:runId`)

Step-by-step execution overlay showing:

- **Heartbeat** — last seen ("5m ago")
- **Uptime** — formatted as "2d 3h" or "45m"
- **Version** — worker version

**Card view**: workers grouped by pool with compact metric cards.

**Worker detail drawer**: click any worker to see full metrics, capabilities, resource usage, and job slots.

---

### Approvals (`/approvals`)

Manage the unified human-in-the-loop approval queue for both safety-policy approvals
and workflow approval gates.

**Tabs**: Queue (pending approvals) | History (resolved approvals)

**Queue tab**:

*Stats strip*: pending count, critical count, average wait time, SLA breaches.

*Filters*: urgency (all/normal/aging/critical), workflow, rule, risk tags, assignment, sort order (wait time, creation, updated).

*Approval cards* show:
- Source badge (`Workflow Gate` or `Safety Policy`)
- Urgency badge (pulsing red for critical)
- Wait time ("Waiting 5m 23s")
- Decision-first title and primary reason
- Decision facts such as amount, vendor, item count, and workflow step when available
- De-emphasized audit metadata (approval ID, job ID, topic, run ID) for quick debugging
- Explicit degraded-context warning when workflow payload hydration is missing or partial

Decision-first cards intentionally prioritize:

1. **What is being approved**
2. **Why it was escalated**
3. **What approval/rejection will do next**

Workflow, run, job, and policy identifiers still appear, but as secondary metadata.

*Detail panel* (right side on wider screens): full approval detail with approve/reject
buttons, optional comment field, and required reason for rejection. The drawer is split
into decision-first sections:

- **Decision summary** — title, reason, escalation callout, degraded-context warning,
  and business facts
- **Workflow context** — workflow name/ID, run link, approval step, and approve/reject
  effect copy
- **Audit details** — policy snapshot, job hash, approval ref, context pointer,
  timestamps, and actor metadata
- **Raw payloads** — collapsible JSON for workflow payloads and job context when those
  payloads exist

*Batch actions toolbar* (when items selected): Approve All, Reject All, Clear Selection. Role-gated to admin/operator.

**History tab**: resolved approvals with decision, actor, reason, and timing. Workflow
approvals retain their decision summary and resolver comments in history so operators can
audit what was approved without reopening raw payloads.

**Fallback behavior**:

- Workflow approvals with complete payloads show vendor/amount/reason/impact prominently.
- Legacy or non-workflow approvals still render safely via policy metadata.
- Missing, malformed, or unavailable workflow context renders an explicit warning instead
  of an empty card shell.
- Loading, empty, and API-error states are handled inline without breaking keyboard or
  drawer navigation.

All filter and selection state persists in URL parameters.

**View modes**: Stream (chronological list, default) | Timeline (time-series chart)

**Live tail**: toggle real-time event streaming (30-second polling). Shows a floating "N new events" button when scrolled away. Auto-pauses when the page is hidden.

**Filters** (all URL-synced for bookmarking):
- Event type (multi-select: allow, deny, auth_failure, etc.)
- Actor (username or service)
- Resource type (job, workflow, policy, etc.)
- Resource ID
- Severity (low/medium/high/critical)
- Outcome (success/failure/pending)
- Time range (preset or custom from/to)

## UI Conventions

**Status badges**: green (success/allow), orange (warning/aging), red (danger/deny/critical), blue (info/dispatched), gray (default/cancelled).

**Data freshness**: most list pages show a "last updated" timestamp with a manual refresh button. Jobs refresh every 10 seconds, approval badge every 30 seconds.

**Filters**: all filter state is persisted in URL query parameters — bookmark filtered views or share URLs with teammates.

**Empty states**: pages show a helpful message with an action button when no data exists (e.g., "No jobs found — try adjusting your filters").

**Loading states**: skeleton rows/cards appear during data fetching. Detail pages show a centered spinner.

**Responsive design**: the dashboard adapts from mobile (single column) to desktop (multi-column grids, side panels).
