# Cordum Roadmap

> **Last Updated:** February 20, 2026

This roadmap outlines our vision for Cordum's evolution. Priorities may shift based on community feedback and production learnings.

## Current Focus: v0.9.0 → v1.0.0 (Q1-Q2 2026)

The path to v1.0.0 focuses on **production hardening** and **API stability**. Backend services, horizontal scaling, and documentation are complete. Remaining work is dashboard UX gaps, observability, and enterprise features.

### Stability & Reliability
- [x] Scheduler reconciler for timeouts/deadlines
- [x] Pending job replayer for stalled/missed dispatches
- [x] Dead-letter queue (DLQ) capture + retry/inspection endpoints
- [x] Saga-based compensation rollback for workflows
- [x] Complete API documentation with OpenAPI spec
- [x] Comprehensive error handling guide
- [x] Disaster recovery playbook
- [x] Horizontal scaling (2-6 replicas of every service)
- [ ] Zero memory leaks over 72h continuous operation (no endurance test yet)

### Performance
- [x] gRPC API option
- [x] Policy caching layer
- [x] Redis connection pool tuning for multi-replica
- [ ] 15k ops/sec policy evaluation throughput (target — no benchmark yet)
- [ ] <5ms p99 end-to-end latency (target — no benchmark yet)
- [ ] ARM64 optimization (15% efficiency target)

### Enterprise Features
- [x] OIDC/SSO integration (with JWKS Redis cache + refresh jitter)
- [x] User/password authentication (separate from API keys)
- [x] Basic role-based access (admin/user)
- [x] Audit event capture (with NATS-backed durable buffer)
- [ ] SAML support
- [ ] Advanced RBAC (resource-level permissions, inheritance)
- [ ] Audit export (JSON, CSV, SIEM)
- [ ] Air-gapped deployment guide
- [ ] FIPS 140-2 compliance mode
