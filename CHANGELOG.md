## [Unreleased]

### Added

#### LLM Chat Assistant — Phase 7 (Docker Compose + Helm packaging)
- **Docker Compose** (`docker-compose.yml`) — new `qwen-inference` and `llm-chat` services gated by `profiles: [llmchat]` so the default `make dev-up` stack stays GPU-free. `qwen-inference` runs `vllm/vllm-openai:latest` with the exact 10-flag form (FP8 model, `qwen3_xml` parser, 131072 context, FP8 KV cache, prefix-caching, gpu-mem-util 0.9, loopback bind `127.0.0.1:8000:8000`). 300s healthcheck `start_period` for the cold load. `llm-chat` uses `depends_on.qwen-inference.condition: service_started` to avoid deadlocking on the 5-minute weight load. Named volume `qwen_hf_cache` persists 30GB FP8 weights across restarts.
- **Helm chart** (`cordum-helm/`) — new `templates/deployment-llm-chat.yaml` (Deployment + Service) and `templates/deployment-qwen-inference.yaml` (PVC + Deployment + Service). Both gated by `.Values.{llmChat,qwenInference}.enabled` (default true). `Service.type: ClusterIP` on both — `qwen-inference` is never exposed externally; `llm-chat` reaches it via in-cluster DNS. External-vLLM mode supported via `llmChat.externalBaseUrl` + `qwenInference.enabled=false`. PVC for HF weight cache (default 50Gi) survives rollouts.
- **`cordum-helm/values.yaml`** — appended full `llmChat` (image, resources, sampling 0.3/0.9 tool + 0.7/0.8 summary, externalBaseUrl) and `qwenInference` (model FP8 + tier2AwqModel reference, qwen3_xml parser, maxModelLen 131072, kvCacheDtype fp8, prefix-caching, gpu nodeSelector + tolerations, hfCache size + storageClass) sections.
- **CI** — `.github/workflows/docker.yml` and `docker-main.yml` matrices extended with `{name: llm-chat, service: cordum-llm-chat}`; the published image at `ghcr.io/cordum-io/cordum/llm-chat` matches the path referenced in compose (slash-separator per project_quickstart_ghcr_path.md).
- **`docs/llmchat/helm.md`** (new) — install/upgrade commands, GPU node prereqs, external-vLLM mode, disable, all 3 hardware tiers (H100 / RTX 5090 AWQ / A100), parser pinning rationale, network exposure boundary, HF cache PVC.

#### LLM Chat Assistant — Phase 2b (read-only Cordum REST API client)
- **`core/llmchat/apiclient.go`** — read-only HTTP client hitting `<gateway>/api/v1/*`. Exposes `ListJobs` (typed `[]model.JobRecord`), `GetJob`, `ListBundles`, `GetBundle`, `ListPolicies`, `GetAuditChain` (typed `*sdk/client.AuditVerifyResult`). All methods are GET; the package contains zero `http.MethodPost|Put|Patch|Delete` constants and a unit test (`apiclient_readonly_test.go`) source-greps the package to fail any PR that adds one. Mutations remain on the MCP path (mcpclient.go) for ApprovalGate + ToolInvocationAuditor governance.
- **Auth hierarchy** mirrors mcpclient: per-call `Authorization: Bearer <delegation-token>` REPLACES the service-account `X-API-Key` (rail #3 — service key never leaks into per-session reads).
- **Bounded retry**: 4xx → no retry, surface typed `*ApiUnauthorizedError`/`*ApiForbiddenError`/`*ApiNotFoundError`/`*ApiClientError`; 5xx + transport errors → exponential backoff (default base 500ms, cap 8s, 3 attempts) → `*ApiServerError`. Bearer token never appears in slog fields.

#### LLM Chat Assistant — Phase 3 (session store + delegation tokens + agent bootstrap)
- **Redis session store** (`core/llmchat/session.go`) — chat sessions persisted at `chat:session:{id}` with 24h sliding TTL refreshed on every AppendMessage. FIFO cap at 50 messages bounds memory under long-lived "Gmail-style" sessions where users return for days. Pinned key format consumed by phase-5 WS handler + admin session viewer.
- **Per-session delegation tokens** (`core/llmchat/delegation.go`) — every chat session mints a child EdDSA JWT (chain depth 1, 15-minute default TTL) via `POST /api/v1/agents/{id}/delegate`. CallTool then carries the JWT in `Authorization: Bearer ...`; the service-account `X-API-Key` is OMITTED on those paths so it never leaks into the per-user tool-call audit trail. `ForSession` auto-refreshes when a token is within 60s of expiry. `Revoke` calls `POST /api/v1/agents/revoke-delegation` with the JTI on session close.
- **Idempotent chat-assistant bootstrap** (`core/llmchat/bootstrap.go`) — first-boot: `cordum_list_agents` filtered by `name=chat-assistant` + tenant. Hit → reuse + verify scope match (rejects divergent identities, never silently accepts). Miss → `cordum_register_agent` with the canonical AllowedTools surface (8 read tools + cordum_query_policy + 5 mutating tools), then `cordum_set_agent_scope` with PreapprovedMutatingTools=[cordum_submit_job] EXACTLY (widening requires policy-bundle update post-ship per epic rail #4). Refuses to proceed when multiple chat-assistant registrations are queued.
- **Chat lifecycle SIEM action constants** (`core/audit/siem_actions.go`) — centralizes `chat.session_started`, `chat.session_closed`, and `chat.bootstrap_registered` so the bootstrap path and phase-5 websocket/session handlers share one action-string source of truth. **WIRE-FORMAT CHANGE:** `SIEMEvent.Action` for chat-assistant bootstrap is now `chat.bootstrap_registered` (was `cap.agent_registered`); SIEM consumers filtering on the old literal must update.
- New env vars on `cordum-llm-chat`: `LLMCHAT_CHAT_ASSISTANT_AGENT_ID` (REQUIRED), `LLMCHAT_TENANT` (optional), `LLMCHAT_DELEGATION_TTL_SECONDS=900` (default 15min).
- Bootstrap runs synchronously on startup under a 30s deadline; failure → exit 1 with structured error log (no silent partial registrations).
- Note: `cap/sdk/go/agent.go` does NOT yet exist; bootstrap uses MCP `cordum_register_agent` + `cordum_set_agent_scope`. Followup task filed in cap repo to add native CAP wrappers; the cordum-side bootstrap will switch over without changing its public surface once those land.

#### Control Plane Boundary Hardening
- **Topic registry** (`GET/POST/DELETE /api/v1/topics`) — canonical source of truth for registered topics with pool, schema, pack, and status metadata
- **Submit-time topic validation** — unknown topics rejected with 400 at both gateway and scheduler boundaries; known topics with zero workers stay valid (degraded, `ErrNoWorkers` retry)
- **Submit-time schema enforcement** — job payloads validated against topic's input schema via JSON Schema draft-07. Modes: `SCHEMA_ENFORCEMENT=enforce|warn|off` (default `warn`)
- **Worker credential store** (`GET/POST/DELETE /api/v1/workers/credentials`) — hashed tokens (argon2id) for worker attestation. Modes: `WORKER_ATTESTATION=enforce|warn|off` (default `off`)
- **Worker readiness handshake** — scheduler filters on `ready == true` when `WORKER_READINESS_REQUIRED=true`. Workers must send handshake with `ready_topics` before receiving jobs. Unknown workers allowed (absence ≠ not ready).
- **Dashboard TopicsPage** — unified view of topics with pool, schema, pack, active workers, and degraded indicators
- **cordumctl topic** subcommands: `list`, `create`, `delete`
- **cordumctl worker credential** subcommands: `create`, `list`, `revoke`
- **SDK client methods** — `ListTopics`, `CreateTopic`, `DeleteTopic`, `ListWorkerCredentials`, `CreateWorkerCredential`, `RevokeWorkerCredential`
- **ADR-009** — Architecture Decision Record for canonical `TopicRegistration`, `WorkerCredential`, `WorkerSnapshot` types
- **Pack manifest schema bindings** — `inputSchema`/`outputSchema` fields on pack topic declarations, validated at install time

#### CAP v2.9.0 Integration
- Upgraded CAP dependency from v2.8.6 to v2.9.0
- `Agent.Start()` now publishes handshake automatically in Go, Python, and Node SDKs — all 36+ workers get handshake at startup with zero code changes
- `Heartbeat.auth_token` (field 18) for worker attestation
- `Handshake.ready_topics` (field 6) for readiness declaration
- `publishHandshake()` added to Python and Node SDKs (previously Go-only)
- Migrated all deprecated `SystemAlert` fields (`Level`, `Component`, `Code`) to structured replacements (`Severity`, `SourceComponent`, `ErrorCodeEnum`)

#### Output Policy System
- Two-phase output safety scanning: fast sync metadata checks on scheduler hot path + deeper async content checks over dereferenced result payloads
- gRPC `OutputPolicyService.CheckOutput` contract in `core/protocol/proto/v1/output_policy.proto`
- Output decisions: `ALLOW`, `QUARANTINE`, `REDACT` with typed findings (`secret_leak`, `pii`, `injection`)

### Fixed

- **scheduler (task-625b2ed1)** — fixed a latent nil-deref in `buildCompensationRequest` (saga.go). The inline `proto.Clone(base).(*pb.JobRequest)` lacked the ok-check every sibling clone site had; on a proto.Clone type-assertion failure the next line would dereference nil and panic the scheduler mid-compensation. Migration to the new `core/protocol/protoutil.CloneJobRequest` helper enforces the ok-check at every call site. Operator impact: none in the happy path; the failure path now returns a wrapped error instead of crashing.
- **audit (task-8db173c5)** — `SyslogExporter.Close` now logs at Warn when the underlying `net.Conn.Close` returns an error (fields: `network`, `address`, `error`). Previously the error was returned opaquely to the `BufferedExporter` close cascade where it could be absorbed silently, masking half-open sockets and TCP-stack fsync failures. Returned-error contract is unchanged.
- **gateway (task-1d4e6b4c bug #2)** — WebSocket `SetReadDeadline` errors at connection setup (`handleStream`, `handleJobStream`) are now propagated: on failure the handler logs at Warn, sets the disconnect state, closes the ws, and returns. Previously the error was discarded and the read loop ran with no deadline, so the server waited indefinitely for a frame that never arrived.
- **gateway (task-1d4e6b4c bug #3)** — `revalidateWSAuthWithRetry` now surfaces the last transient error after 3 exhausted retries instead of returning nil. A NATS/Redis outage during revalidation previously kept a potentially-revoked session alive for the full 2-minute revalidation window; callers already branch on `err != nil` and will close the connection, letting the dashboard auto-reconnect. `ctx.Done()` still returns nil — caller-initiated shutdown is not a failure.
- **safety-kernel (task-681f83cd)** — `shadowTimeout` now actually bounds the per-submission shadow evaluation loop. The `context.WithTimeout` return was previously discarded; captured + plumbed through `evalShadowSafely` with a `ctx.Err()` check at bundle-iteration top.

#### Critical
- **NATS reconnect** — Safety kernel and scheduler re-subscribe to `sys.config.changed` on NATS reconnect. Previously degraded silently to 30s polling on network partition.
- **Config scope corruption** — `SetWithRetry` now deep-merges config updates, preserving existing keys. Policy bundles no longer silently wiped by pools config pushes. Startup migration moves stale bundles to correct scope.
- **E2E TLS job dispatch** (`task-73bc2227`) — fixed `tools/scripts/e2e_test.sh` Phase 4 on TLS compose stacks. The script now auto-detects `./certs/ca/ca.crt`, uses `tls://` / `rediss://`, passes `NATS_TLS_CA` / `NATS_TLS_CERT` / `NATS_TLS_KEY` plus `REDIS_TLS_CA` / `REDIS_TLS_CERT` / `REDIS_TLS_KEY` to `examples/hello-worker-go`, installs `./examples/hello-worker-go/pack/pack.yaml` so `job.hello-pack.echo` is registered before submit, treats missing Phase 4 readiness/completion as hard failures while parsing the canonical `/api/v1/workers` `items` response, and the gateway `unknown_topic` response now includes tenant-filtered `registered_topics` (capped at 20) plus `topics_endpoint`.
- **cordumctl topic registration** — `pack install` now registers topics in topic registry; `pack uninstall` removes them. Fixes #171.
- **cordumctl lock release** — `runPackInstall` and `runPackUninstall` return errors instead of `os.Exit(1)`, ensuring deferred lock release fires on all error paths.
- **Safety Kernel NATS subscription** — subscribes to `sys.config.changed` for immediate policy reload (was poll-only with 30s delay).
- **cordumctl JSON tags** — `packTests` structs now have `json:"..."` tags matching YAML tags, fixing silent registry data corruption.

#### High
- **Panic recovery** — all NATS subscription callbacks wrapped with `defer recover()` + stack trace logging
- **Readiness filter** — unknown workers allowed (absence ≠ not ready), preventing new worker traffic starvation
- **Credential cache** — async refresh in NATS handler (prevents scheduler throughput collapse), merge-on-failure (prevents stale cache)
- **Rollback reporting** — cordumctl rollback errors tracked and returned, non-zero exit on partial rollback
- **Approval stale_request false negative** — single-step approval workflows no longer get auto-invalidated as `stale_request` immediately after `POST /approve`. The gateway approve endpoint now locks the current `HashJobRequest(req)` into `SafetyDecisionRecord.JobHash`, and `scheduler.checkSafetyDecision` preserves a prior `JobHash` from gateway submit instead of clobbering it with a post-effective-config mutation hash; hash-fence store read failures retry without publishing instead of falling through the input fail-open path. This is a bug fix, not an API contract change; clients that only observed the spurious `invalidate_stale_request` path should now see the benign approval succeed again. Follow-up to commit `297937c7` and guard task `task-035cdc8e`.
- **Dashboard memory leaks** — duplicate WebSocket, IntersectionObserver, CSV blob URL timing
- **Dashboard error handling** — LoginPage 4xx, RunDetailPage chat error, PackDetailPage null state
- **Dashboard a11y** — focus traps on modals, aria-labels on stats, localStorage try-catch
- **Security logging** — `slog.Info`/`slog.Warn` for credential and topic operations
- **Input validation** — array length limits (max 100 items, 128 chars), URL encoding on dynamic links
- **lodash** — CVE-2026-4800, CVE-2026-2950 fixed upstream in 4.18.0; bumped to 4.18.1 as the latest safe release.

#### System Audit Bug Fixes (25 tasks)
- Gateway: Fixed SSRF in marketplace URL validation — added private IP filtering for RFC 1918/loopback/link-local addresses
- Gateway: Hardened public path matching to prevent auth bypass on path variations
- Gateway: Rate limit middleware now runs after API key authentication (was running before, allowing bypass)
- Gateway: Error responses sanitized to prevent internal stack trace leakage
- Scheduler: Fixed per-run mutex for concurrent engine execution
- Scheduler: Fixed reconciler race conditions in timeout handling
- Scheduler: Fixed pending replayer edge cases
- Workflow engine: Fixed stale closure bugs using `useRef` pattern
- Workflow engine: Fixed dependency array triggers in hooks
- Config: Fixed safety policy schema validation
- Memory store: Fixed job store edge cases in concurrent access

- `bufio.Scanner.Err()` checked after scan loops across codebase

#### Dashboard-to-Backend Integration Bug Fixes
- Transform layer handles API contract mismatches between backend `{scope, data}` wrapper and frontend flat expectations
- Policy bundle detail mapping: parse rules from YAML content instead of hardcoding `rules: []`
- Visual rule builder: use shared `usePolicyBundle()` hook instead of local bypass
- `resolvePublishTargets()`: fixed `secops/` prefix requirement so pack bundles can publish

### Changed

- **core: extracted Unix-timestamp → RFC3339 formatter into `core/infra/timeutil` (task-e396a874)** — 5 inline formatters migrated: `FormatUnixAuto` (handlers_chat.go magnitude cascade) + typed `FromSeconds`/`FromMillis`/`FromMicros`/`FromNanos` for compile-time-known units. Byte-for-byte identical output; empty string on `ts<=0` preserved per site.
- **core: extracted `proto.Clone((*pb.JobRequest))` guard-pattern into `core/protocol/protoutil.CloneJobRequest` (task-625b2ed1)** — 4 inline call sites migrated to one helper with typed ok-check + nil guard. See the paired `Fixed` entry for the latent saga.go:322 nil-deref this closed. JobMetadata clone sites in saga.go not migrated (different type, separate follow-up if drift emerges).
- **gateway: removed packs_compat.go + policy_compat.go (task-a828e179)** — 233 lines of pure-alias shims deleted. Every caller (~40 files) now imports `core/controlplane/gateway/packs` or `core/controlplane/gateway/policybundles` directly and uses the fully-qualified `packs.PascalCase` / `policybundles.PascalCase` shape. `resolveAgentForAudit` moved to `handlers_agents.go`. Internal refactor; no public API change.
- **core: extracted Redis CAS retry loop into `core/infra/redisutil/Retry`** — 4 production call sites (gateway keystore_redis RevokeKey + mcp_approvals Consume/Resolve/SweepExpired) now share a single retry primitive with `WithMaxAttempts`/`WithKeys` options and an `ErrMaxAttemptsExceeded` sentinel. Behavior byte-equivalent. Closes task-c7e419d8.
- **core: unified JobRequest canonicalisation into `core/protocol/reqhash`** — single `Canonical` + `Hash` helper shared by scheduler, gateway, and store; five bare `protojson.Unmarshal` sites in `core/infra/store/job_store.go` now pass `DiscardUnknown: true`. See release notes for the Redis WATCH/MULTI atomic-store decision. Closes task-090ab6af.
- Auth: Login endpoint supports both user credentials and API keys
- Auth: AuthConfig includes `user_auth_enabled` and `saml_enterprise` fields
- Scheduler: Output policy integration in dispatch pipeline
- Workflow engine: Support for 6 new step types alongside existing job/fan-out/condition/delay/approval/notify
- Dashboard: Sidebar navigation consolidated to 9+1 items (removed /context, /pools, /system, /trace, /tools)
- Dashboard: Routes reorganized under new page structure
- Safety kernel: Policy fragments from config service merged with file/URL policy on load/reload

#### CAP v2.5.2 Protocol Integration
- Upgraded CAP protocol dependency from v2.0.19 to v2.5.2 (both `go.mod` and `sdk/go.mod`)
- All NATS-connected services publish `Handshake` on `sys.handshake` at startup for capability discovery (gateway, scheduler, workflow-engine; workers via SDK runtime)
- `SystemAlert` now includes `severity` enum, `error_code_enum`, `source_component`, `details` map, and `trace_id` (deprecated string fields still populated)
- `JobResult` error codes use structured `ErrorCode` enum alongside string `error_code` for backward compatibility
- Bus-layer validation rejects malformed `JobRequest`/`JobResult` messages using CAP SDK helpers (`validation_rejections_total` metric)
- Scheduler handles `BusPacket{Handshake}` in its message switch, updating the worker registry with component capabilities
- Dashboard displays structured error code badges on job detail page and enhanced alert severity in audit log
- Added conformance test fixtures for all 8 CAP packet types with signature verification
- SDK runtime exposes `ValidateJobRequest`, `ValidateJobResult`, `Handshake`, `ComponentRole`, `ErrorCode`, `AlertSeverity` types

### Removed

- Retired the `cordum-enterprise` repo — all enterprise features (SSO/SAML, SCIM, advanced RBAC, SIEM export, legal hold, velocity rules, agent identity) now ship in cordum core behind license entitlements; separate repo archived on GitHub. Closes task-b7c6c2f1. See release notes for full surface list.
- Removed the legacy OpenAPI sidecars `docs/api/openapi/cordum-rest.yaml`
  and `docs/api/openapi/cordum.swagger.json`. `docs/api/openapi/cordum-api.yaml`
  is now the single canonical OpenAPI 3 spec, `make openapi` is a pure
  Redocly validation pass, and the local/public Swagger UI wrappers now load
  only that canonical spec. Also removed the legacy prefixed MCP transport
  aliases `/api/v1/mcp/{sse,message,status}`; MCP transport is now exposed
  only at `/mcp/{sse,message,status}` while MCP governance REST endpoints
  remain under `/api/v1/mcp/*`. See
  [`docs/cleanup/openapi-legacy-audit.md`](docs/cleanup/openapi-legacy-audit.md)
  `Audit re-verification 2026-04-23` for the ground-truth timeline.

### Security
- **WebSocket quarantine-redaction fail-closed (task-1d4e6b4c bug #1)** — the filter that strips `ResultPtr` + `ArtifactPtrs` from DENIED `JobResult` packets before broadcasting to WebSocket subscribers previously FAILED OPEN on `proto.Clone` type-assertion failure AND on the defensive `cloned.GetJobResult() == nil` branch, returning the original unredacted packet. Redis-stored result payloads may contain PII, user prompts, secrets, or model outputs; the filter now fails CLOSED: returns nil on any failure, `enqueueBusPacket` drops the broadcast, `cordum_gateway_ws_quarantine_redaction_drops_total` increments, and an error is logged with `job_id` + `trace_id`. The next state-change event arrives in the normal stream cadence.
- Session tokens: Replaced timestamp-based tokens with `crypto/rand` (was only 53 bits entropy)
- HSTS: Added `Strict-Transport-Security` headers
- Brute-force protection: Added login attempt rate limiting
- Password policy: Enforced minimum complexity requirements
- Docker healthchecks: Added health endpoints to all container services
- Kubernetes: Fixed dashboard deployment manifest
- Kubernetes: Added egress network policies
- Redis: Configured persistence for production durability
- Gosec findings mitigated across codebase (G117 suppressions for intentional secret/password fields)
- OIDC host validation fix

### Tests

- Added workflow engine tests: loop, parallel, storage, sub-workflow, switch, transform step types
- Added output policy tests: engine output, safety client, protobuf
- Added dashboard component tests: Badge, CollapsibleSection, ComboboxInput, ConfirmDialog, Drawer, HighlightText, TagInput
- Added dashboard hook tests: useApprovals, useAudit, useAuth, useAuthConfig, useCrossTabSync, useDLQ, useJobs, useKeyboardShortcuts, useMemory, useOutputPolicy, useOutputRules, usePacks, usePageTitle, usePermission, usePolicies, useRunStream, useSchemas, useSettings, useSetupStatus, useStatus, useToast, useUrlFilters, useWorkers, useWorkflows

- Added dashboard state tests: config, toast, ui
- Added dashboard page tests: DLQPage, SettingsLayout, SetupChecklist, SystemHealthTab, UsersTab
- Added API client and transform layer tests

### Dashboard UI Polish Wave (2026-04-25)
- **Soft UI Evolution** — Button/Card/Tabs primitives migrated to `rounded-xl` + `duration-[var(--duration-soft)]` (250ms); `--shadow-soft`, `--shadow-soft-hover`, `--radius: 0.75rem` design tokens consumed at call sites; regression-pinned by `dashboard/src/components/ui/SoftUiEvolution.test.ts`
- **Per-row motion stagger** on Jobs / Audit / Agents tables via `motion.tbody` + `motion.tr` with `staggerChildren: 0.04` and `useReducedMotion`-honoring item variants
- **Staggered motion entry** on PolicyOverviewPage + SimulatorPage matching `HomePage.tsx:317-350` idiom
- **MotionConfig** — global `<MotionConfig reducedMotion="user">` wrapper at `App.tsx:201` so all `motion.*` descendants honor `prefers-reduced-motion`
- **RunDetailPage step-list a11y** — `role="listbox"` parent + `role="option"` items with `tabIndex=0`, `aria-selected`, `aria-label`, `onKeyDown` (Enter + Space, `preventDefault`), focus-visible ring
- **axe-core a11y gate** — automated accessibility test suite (`*.a11y.test.tsx`) covering HomePage, PolicyOverviewPage, SettingsHubPage in light and dark modes; `aria-pressed` added to toggle-state buttons (live-mode, etc.)
- **`useAdminLocks` role gate** — `enabled: useIsAdmin()` short-circuits the 5s `/admin/locks` poll for non-admin users (was emitting 720 `403`s/hour and a silent blank LockInspector card); LockInspector now renders an `EmptyState` admin-required card on `!isAdmin`
- **`useDelegations` test fix** — race-prone unhandled rejection silenced via no-op `mutation.catch(() => {})` immediately after `mutateAsync`; rollback path now asserts `setQueryData(allKey/agentKey, seeded)` explicitly
- **`mapJobRecord` origin refs** — `BackendJobRecord` interface declares `workflow_run_id`, `labels`, and `metadata` as optional fields; `mapJobRecord` forwards them onto the returned `Job` so the JobsPage list `OriginPill` correctly renders Run/Session pills (was always falling through to Direct because the list-mapper stripped the fields that `mapJobDetail` adds back)
- **`backdrop-filter` `@supports` fallback** — Safari `<14` and iOS Safari `<14` now render `.glass-panel` / `.glass-sidebar` / `.glass-header` with opaque `var(--card)` background; PostCSS/Tailwind autoprefixer auto-extended the rule to cover `-webkit-backdrop-filter`
- **GovernanceVerificationPage** at `/govern/verification` (admin-gated via `RequireRole`); routing guard test added so missing `<Route>` registrations fail tsc + vitest
- **`instrument-card` sweep** — 5 Policy Studio routes + ApprovalDetailPage / SettingsMcpPage / RunDetailPage internal info blocks adopted the shared instrument-card primitive
- **Dashboard 12-col Bento Grid** — BundleDetailPage + JobDetailPage + AgentDetailPage refactored to `grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-12` with framer-motion staggered tile entry; RunDetailPage explicitly *exempted* (full-viewport 3-pane console shell is non-bento by design — see `dashboard/docs/design-system-audit.md` § DoD-3 exemptions)
- **Brand identity** — favicons + logo refresh

### Strategic Decisions (2026-04-25)
- **Dashboard i18n DEFERRED post-Visa** (task-530874ea) — zero `useTranslation`/`i18next`/`FormattedMessage`/`t(` adoption today; ~1500-key migration cost weighed against zero current external-customer demand and the project_strategic_direction "governance depth over breadth" rail. Follow-up `task-8c4cdcaf` filed in BACKLOG for post-Visa revisit.
- **LLM epic backlogged** (epic-ac495830) — same logic: not the right priority pre-Visa.

### Process Rails (proposed; pending human approval)
- `prop-8cc95268` — DASHBOARD VERIFICATION RAIL: tasks touching `cordum/dashboard/` MUST run `tsc --noEmit` + `npx vitest run` + `npm run build` and paste each summary line into the final `complete_step` note before `complete_task`. Docker-build-success is NOT a substitute (Vite bundles through type errors; the rail closes that loophole).
- `prop-5a162a16` — DASHBOARD QA REJECTION FORMAT: QA must cite the first failing gate and, for vitest failures, the first new failing test as `<describe> > <it> (<path>:<line>)`.

## [v0.3.0] - 2026-01-31
- Protocol/SDK: bump CAP to v2.0.19 across core + SDK modules.
- SDK: `sdk/runtime` now wraps CAP runtime (typed handlers + pointer hydration).
- SDK: add CAP bus helpers for progress/cancel/heartbeats + direct worker subjects.
- Examples: migrate workers to CAP runtime + direct-subject subscriptions.
- Breaking: legacy `sdk/runtime` worker API removed; use `runtime.Agent` + CAP worker helpers.

## [v0.2.0] - 2026-01-26
- Scheduler: add durable saga/compensation handling with reverse-stack rollback for fatal failures.
- Scheduler: add compensation idempotency keys and saga rollback metrics.
- Protocol: align job status handling with CAP v2.0.16 (FAILED_FATAL/FAILED_RETRYABLE).
- Workflow engine: treat FAILED_FATAL as terminal and FAILED_RETRYABLE as retryable.
- Security/docs: updated control-plane docs/wiki for saga semantics and CAP changes.
- Tests: added coverage for saga manager, safety kernel cache/URL validation, protobuf + grpc stubs, and Redis idempotency flows.

## [v0.1.4] - 2026-01-25
- Security: remove default API keys; deployments must supply `CORDUM_API_KEY`.
- Security: fail-closed API auth; enforce `X-Tenant-ID`; require policy signatures when enforcement is enabled.
