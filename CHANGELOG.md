## [Unreleased]

### Added

#### Control Plane Boundary Hardening
- **Topic registry** (`GET/POST/DELETE /api/v1/topics`) — canonical source of truth for registered topics with pool, schema, pack, and status metadata
- **Submit-time topic validation** — unknown topics rejected with 400 at both gateway and scheduler boundaries; known topics with zero workers stay valid (degraded, `ErrNoWorkers` retry)
- **Submit-time schema enforcement** — job payloads validated against topic's input schema via JSON Schema draft-07. Modes: `SCHEMA_ENFORCEMENT=enforce|warn|off` (default `warn`)
- **Worker credential store** (`GET/POST/DELETE /api/v1/workers/credentials`) — hashed tokens (argon2id) for worker attestation. Modes: `WORKER_ATTESTATION=enforce|warn|off` (default `off`)
- **Worker readiness handshake** — scheduler filters on `ready == true` when `WORKER_READINESS_REQUIRED=true`. Workers must send handshake with `ready_topics` before receiving jobs. Unknown workers allowed (absence ≠ not ready).
- **Dashboard TopicsPage** — unified view of topics with pool, schema, pack, active workers, and degraded indicators
- **cordumctl topic** subcommands: `list`, `create`, `delete`
- **cordumctl worker credential** subcommands: `create`, `list`, `revoke`
- **SDK client methods** — `ListTopics`, `CreateTopic`, `DeleteTopic`, `ListWorkerCredentials`, `CreateWorkerCredential`, `RevokeWorkerCredential`
- **ADR-009** — Architecture Decision Record for canonical `TopicRegistration`, `WorkerCredential`, `WorkerSnapshot` types
- **Pack manifest schema bindings** — `inputSchema`/`outputSchema` fields on pack topic declarations, validated at install time

#### CAP v2.9.0 Integration
- Upgraded CAP dependency from v2.8.6 to v2.9.0
- `Agent.Start()` now publishes handshake automatically in Go, Python, and Node SDKs — all 36+ workers get handshake at startup with zero code changes
- `Heartbeat.auth_token` (field 18) for worker attestation
- `Handshake.ready_topics` (field 6) for readiness declaration
- `publishHandshake()` added to Python and Node SDKs (previously Go-only)
- Migrated all deprecated `SystemAlert` fields (`Level`, `Component`, `Code`) to structured replacements (`Severity`, `SourceComponent`, `ErrorCodeEnum`)

### Fixed

#### Critical
- **NATS reconnect** — Safety kernel and scheduler re-subscribe to `sys.config.changed` on NATS reconnect. Previously degraded silently to 30s polling on network partition.
- **Config scope corruption** — `SetWithRetry` now deep-merges config updates, preserving existing keys. Policy bundles no longer silently wiped by pools config pushes. Startup migration moves stale bundles to correct scope.
- **E2E TLS job dispatch** (`task-73bc2227`) — fixed `tools/scripts/e2e_test.sh` Phase 4 on TLS compose stacks. The script now auto-detects `./certs/ca/ca.crt`, uses `tls://` / `rediss://`, passes `NATS_TLS_CA` / `NATS_TLS_CERT` / `NATS_TLS_KEY` plus `REDIS_TLS_CA` / `REDIS_TLS_CERT` / `REDIS_TLS_KEY` to `examples/hello-worker-go`, installs `./examples/hello-worker-go/pack/pack.yaml` so `job.hello-pack.echo` is registered before submit, treats missing Phase 4 readiness/completion as hard failures while parsing the canonical `/api/v1/workers` `items` response, and the gateway `unknown_topic` response now includes tenant-filtered `registered_topics` (capped at 20) plus `topics_endpoint`.
- **cordumctl topic registration** — `pack install` now registers topics in topic registry; `pack uninstall` removes them. Fixes #171.
- **cordumctl lock release** — `runPackInstall` and `runPackUninstall` return errors instead of `os.Exit(1)`, ensuring deferred lock release fires on all error paths.
- **Safety Kernel NATS subscription** — subscribes to `sys.config.changed` for immediate policy reload (was poll-only with 30s delay).
- **cordumctl JSON tags** — `packTests` structs now have `json:"..."` tags matching YAML tags, fixing silent registry data corruption.

#### High
- **Panic recovery** — all NATS subscription callbacks wrapped with `defer recover()` + stack trace logging
- **Readiness filter** — unknown workers allowed (absence ≠ not ready), preventing new worker traffic starvation
- **Credential cache** — async refresh in NATS handler (prevents scheduler throughput collapse), merge-on-failure (prevents stale cache)
- **Rollback reporting** — cordumctl rollback errors tracked and returned, non-zero exit on partial rollback
- **Approval stale_request false negative** — single-step approval workflows no longer get auto-invalidated as `stale_request` immediately after `POST /approve`. The gateway approve endpoint now locks the current `HashJobRequest(req)` into `SafetyDecisionRecord.JobHash`, and `scheduler.checkSafetyDecision` preserves a prior `JobHash` from gateway submit instead of clobbering it with a post-effective-config mutation hash; hash-fence store read failures retry without publishing instead of falling through the input fail-open path. This is a bug fix, not an API contract change; clients that only observed the spurious `invalidate_stale_request` path should now see the benign approval succeed again. Follow-up to commit `297937c7` and guard task `task-035cdc8e`.
- **Dashboard memory leaks** — duplicate WebSocket, IntersectionObserver, CSV blob URL timing
- **Dashboard error handling** — LoginPage 4xx, RunDetailPage chat error, PackDetailPage null state
- **Dashboard a11y** — focus traps on modals, aria-labels on stats, localStorage try-catch
- **Security logging** — `slog.Info`/`slog.Warn` for credential and topic operations
- **Input validation** — array length limits (max 100 items, 128 chars), URL encoding on dynamic links
- **lodash** bumped to 4.18.1 (CVE-2026-4800, CVE-2026-2950)

### Changed

#### CAP v2.5.2 Protocol Integration
- Upgraded CAP protocol dependency from v2.0.19 to v2.5.2 (both `go.mod` and `sdk/go.mod`)
- All NATS-connected services publish `Handshake` on `sys.handshake` at startup for capability discovery (gateway, scheduler, workflow-engine; workers via SDK runtime)
- `SystemAlert` now includes `severity` enum, `error_code_enum`, `source_component`, `details` map, and `trace_id` (deprecated string fields still populated)
- `JobResult` error codes use structured `ErrorCode` enum alongside string `error_code` for backward compatibility
- Bus-layer validation rejects malformed `JobRequest`/`JobResult` messages using CAP SDK helpers (`validation_rejections_total` metric)
- Scheduler handles `BusPacket{Handshake}` in its message switch, updating the worker registry with component capabilities
- Dashboard displays structured error code badges on job detail page and enhanced alert severity in audit log
- Added conformance test fixtures for all 8 CAP packet types with signature verification
- SDK runtime exposes `ValidateJobRequest`, `ValidateJobResult`, `Handshake`, `ComponentRole`, `ErrorCode`, `AlertSeverity` types

### Removed

- Removed the legacy OpenAPI sidecars `docs/api/openapi/cordum-rest.yaml`
  and `docs/api/openapi/cordum.swagger.json`. `docs/api/openapi/cordum-api.yaml`
  is now the single canonical OpenAPI 3 spec, `make openapi` is a pure
  Redocly validation pass, and the local/public Swagger UI wrappers now load
  only that canonical spec. Also removed the legacy prefixed MCP transport
  aliases `/api/v1/mcp/{sse,message,status}`; MCP transport is now exposed
  only at `/mcp/{sse,message,status}` while MCP governance REST endpoints
  remain under `/api/v1/mcp/*`. See
  [`docs/cleanup/openapi-legacy-audit.md`](docs/cleanup/openapi-legacy-audit.md)
  `Audit re-verification 2026-04-23` for the ground-truth timeline.

## [v0.3.0] - 2026-01-31
- Protocol/SDK: bump CAP to v2.0.19 across core + SDK modules.
- SDK: `sdk/runtime` now wraps CAP runtime (typed handlers + pointer hydration).
- SDK: add CAP bus helpers for progress/cancel/heartbeats + direct worker subjects.
- Examples: migrate workers to CAP runtime + direct-subject subscriptions.
- Breaking: legacy `sdk/runtime` worker API removed; use `runtime.Agent` + CAP worker helpers.

## [v0.2.0] - 2026-01-26
- Scheduler: add durable saga/compensation handling with reverse-stack rollback for fatal failures.
- Scheduler: add compensation idempotency keys and saga rollback metrics.
- Protocol: align job status handling with CAP v2.0.16 (FAILED_FATAL/FAILED_RETRYABLE).
- Workflow engine: treat FAILED_FATAL as terminal and FAILED_RETRYABLE as retryable.
- Security/docs: updated control-plane docs/wiki for saga semantics and CAP changes.
- Tests: added coverage for saga manager, safety kernel cache/URL validation, protobuf + grpc stubs, and Redis idempotency flows.

## [v0.1.4] - 2026-01-25
- Security: remove default API keys; deployments must supply `CORDUM_API_KEY`.
- Security: fail-closed API auth; enforce `X-Tenant-ID`; require policy signatures when enforcement is enabled.
- Dashboard: disable API key storage in localStorage (opt-in embed via `CORDUM_DASHBOARD_EMBED_API_KEY`).
- Breaking: clients must send `X-Tenant-ID` on all `/api/*` requests.
