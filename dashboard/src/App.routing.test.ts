// Regression guard for missing-route bugs.
//
// Page-level tests (e.g. GovernanceVerificationPage.test.tsx) render the
// component inside a hand-rolled <Routes> block and never import App.tsx, so
// they cannot detect when a page exists but was never wired into the
// production router. This source-regex gate covers that gap by asserting
// that App.tsx both lazy-imports the component and registers the route.
//
// To add a route to the guard, append to REGISTERED_ROUTES with a short
// `why` that points to the originating task or surface.
