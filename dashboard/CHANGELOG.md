# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Replace Copilot Session detail placeholder with full timeline (messages,
  governance decisions, linked jobs) backed by the new
  `/api/v1/copilot/sessions/:sessionId` endpoint and `useCopilotSession` hook
  (task-da7eaef7).
- RunDetailPage mobile responsive: 2-pane console (steps + chat) collapses to tab-switched vertical stack at <md with 44px tap targets (WCAG 2.5.5) and a `useReducedMotion`-guarded step-list stagger. Desktop md+ 2-pane layout unchanged. Closes DoD-5 mobile-responsive gap (task-671f49cd).
- Pinned `--duration-soft: 250ms` consumption in `Button` + `Card` primitives via 2 source-regex assertions in `DesignSystemConvergence.test.ts`. The token was already adopted in commit 1b95ac65 (task-bd7eb4af Soft UI Evolution); this change closes the orphan-token spec drift by making the consumption mechanically guarded against drift back to `duration-300` (task-ed23bcf5).
- Premium-sweep parity for 7 pages: `PackDetailPage`, `MCPPage`, `EvalsPage`, `EvalDatasetDetailPage`, `EvalRunDetailPage` now render `instrument-card` + framer-motion entry animation; `PacksPage` (already had both) and `DelegationsPage` (added motion entry) brought to parity. 14 source-level DoD assertions added to `DesignSystemConvergence.test.ts` with permissive helpers that accept either the `instrument-card` class literal or `<InstrumentCard>` component form (task-6297b2a4).
- Added the Evals dashboard page (`/evals` + `/evals/:datasetId` + `/evals/runs/:runId`) turning denied incidents into a policy regression suite. Dataset list with score badges and regression dots, incident extraction dialog with dry-run preview and 409 collision messaging that respects dataset immutability, dataset detail view with Recharts score-trend chart (30-run window, red markers on regression runs) and run history, and a run detail view with filterable accordion drill-down of per-entry pass/fail/regression/error results. Shipped dark behind `FEATURE_FLAGS.evalsPage` (opt-in via `VITE_EVALS_PAGE=true`) until the three sibling backend tasks land, with dev-only fixture handlers under `src/mocks/handlers/evals.ts`.
- Added the Governance Timeline dashboard surface for job and workflow detail views. Enabled by default in every environment — the `/api/v1/governance/decisions` backend is live so the Governance tab is visible on `JobDetailPage.tsx` and `RunDetailPage.tsx` without any feature flag.
- `FEATURE_FLAGS.governanceTimeline` is retained as a permanently-true value only so existing imports compile; the prod-default-off gate that QA flagged has been removed.
- Development-only governance fixture handlers remain under `src/mocks/handlers/governance.ts` so a developer without a running gateway can still exercise the timeline locally. Mocks never load in production or test builds.
