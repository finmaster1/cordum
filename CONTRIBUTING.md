# Contributing to Cordum

Thanks for helping improve Cordum.

## Getting started

- Go toolchain: `go 1.24`
- Tests: `go test ./...`
- Format: `gofmt -w` on Go files

## Development workflow

1. Fork the repo and create a feature branch.
2. Make focused changes (small, reviewable commits).
3. Update docs in `docs/` when you add commands, binaries, or behavior changes.
4. Run tests locally (`go test ./...`).
5. Open a PR with a clear description and test results.

## Collaborator requests

`Collaborator request: <your name>` and include:
