# Cordum Enterprise

Enterprise features are delivered by the `cordum-enterprise` repo and require
signed licenses. The core repo stays focused on the platform-only control plane
and is licensed under BUSL-1.1.

## Current enterprise features

- Enterprise API gateway binary with license enforcement
- Enterprise auth provider (multi-tenant API keys + RBAC)
- User/password authentication with bcrypt-secured credentials
- SSO/SAML integration
- Audit export (JSON, CSV, SIEM)
- Advanced RBAC controls

License loading, validation, and tier enforcement now live in core
(`core/licensing/`). The core licensing system uses Ed25519 signature
verification and enforces three tiers (Community/Team/Enterprise) with
entitlement limits across all services (gateway rate limits, scheduler
concurrency, workflow steps, safety kernel policy bundles, audit retention).
Licenses degrade gracefully to Community tier on expiry.

The enterprise repo provides license **issuance**, SSO/SAML, and advanced RBAC.

Configuration variables (set in core):
- `CORDUM_LICENSE_FILE` — path to the signed license file
- `CORDUM_LICENSE_TOKEN` — inline license token (alternative to file)
- `CORDUM_LICENSE_PUBLIC_KEY` — Ed25519 public key for signature verification

## Authentication

The platform supports multiple authentication methods:

### API Key Authentication (default)
- Set via `CORDUM_API_KEY` or `CORDUM_API_KEYS`
- Used for programmatic access (scripts, CI/CD, workers)
- Sent via `X-API-Key` header

### User/Password Authentication
- Enable with `CORDUM_USER_AUTH_ENABLED=true`
- Users stored in Redis with bcrypt-hashed passwords
- Supports login via username or email
- Admin can create users via `POST /api/v1/users`
- Users can change password via `POST /api/v1/auth/password`

### SSO/SAML (Enterprise)
- Integrates with identity providers (Okta, Azure AD, etc.)
- Marked with "Enterprise" badge in dashboard
- Configure via SAML environment variables

## Planned enterprise extensions

- Air-gapped deployment guide
- FIPS 140-2 compliance mode
- Dedicated support tooling

## Licensing model

- Core (`cordum`): Business Source License 1.1 (free for self-hosted use; no
  competing hosted/managed offering).
- Enterprise (`cordum-enterprise`): commercial EULA.
- Protocol/SDK (`cap`): Apache-2.0.
