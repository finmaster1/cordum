# Packs (Technical + How-To)

This document defines the pack format and installation flow for Cordum.
Packs are installable overlays (workflows + schemas + config/policy fragments) that
extend the platform **without core code changes**.

## Pack goals (v0)

- API-native installs via gateway + config service.
- No arbitrary code execution during install.
- Namespaced resources to avoid collisions.
- Soft uninstall by default (disable routing + policy; keep workflows/schemas).

## Pack bundle format

A pack is either:
- a directory containing `pack.yaml`, or
- a `.tgz` archive whose root contains `pack.yaml` (or a single top-level folder with it).

## Scaffold a pack

Generate a minimal pack skeleton:

```bash
cordumctl pack create my-pack
```

## Marketplace catalogs

Cordum can discover and install packs from catalog JSON files. Catalogs are configured
in the config service under `cfg:system:pack_catalogs`:

Catalog entries may include an optional `image` URL for UI pack cards.

Official catalog source: `https://github.com/cordum-io/cordum-packs` (published to `https://packs.cordum.io`).

The gateway seeds `cfg:system:pack_catalogs` with the official catalog if the
document is missing or empty. Override or disable with:
- `CORDUM_PACK_CATALOG_URL`
- `CORDUM_PACK_CATALOG_ID`
- `CORDUM_PACK_CATALOG_TITLE`
- `CORDUM_PACK_CATALOG_DEFAULT_DISABLED=1`

```json
{
  "catalogs": [
    {
      "id": "official",
      "title": "Cordum Official",
      "url": "https://packs.cordum.io/catalog.json",
      "enabled": true
    }
  ]
}
```

Gateway endpoints:
- `GET /api/v1/marketplace/packs` (merged catalog view + installed status)
- `POST /api/v1/marketplace/install` (install by catalog or URL)

Install by catalog:

```json
{
  "catalog_id": "official",
  "pack_id": "sre-k8s-triage",
  "version": "0.3.1"
}
```

Install by URL (sha256 required):

```json
{
  "url": "https://packs.cordum.io/packs/sre-k8s-triage/0.3.1/pack.tgz",
  "sha256": "<sha256>"
}
```

The gateway downloads the bundle, verifies sha256, and runs the same install flow as
`cordumctl pack install`. Only `http`/`https` URLs are supported.
Direct URL installs must match a pack URL present in an enabled marketplace catalog
and the provided sha256 must match the catalog entry.

### Bundle safety limits (gateway)

To avoid zip-slip and oversized uploads, the gateway enforces:
- Max upload size: 64 MiB
- Max files: 2048
- Max file size: 32 MiB
- Max uncompressed size: 256 MiB
- Absolute paths and `..` segments are rejected during extraction

### Directory layout (recommended)

```
my-pack/
  pack.yaml
  workflows/
    triage.yaml
  schemas/
    IncidentContext.json
    IncidentResult.json
  overlays/
    pools.patch.yaml
    timeouts.patch.yaml
    policy.fragment.yaml
  deploy/
    docker-compose.yaml
```

`deploy/` artifacts are informational only. Core does not deploy workers.

Example pack (in this repo):
- `examples/hello-pack` (minimal workflow + schema + overlays)

External reference pack:
- `cordum-packs/packs/mcp-bridge` (MCP stdio bridge + pack)

## pack.yaml schema (v0)

Required fields:

```yaml
apiVersion: cordum.io/v1alpha1
kind: Pack

metadata:
  id: sre-investigator
  version: 0.3.1
  title: SRE Investigator
  description: Incident triage + evidence collection.
  image: https://cdn.simpleicons.org/slack

compatibility:
  protocolVersion: 1
  minCoreVersion: 0.6.0

topics:
  - name: job.sre-investigator.collect.k8s
    inputSchema: sre-investigator/IncidentContext
    outputSchema: sre-investigator/IncidentResult
    requires: ["kubectl", "network:egress"]
    riskTags: ["network"]
    capability: sre.collect.k8s

resources:
  schemas:
    - id: sre-investigator/IncidentContext
      path: schemas/IncidentContext.json
    - id: sre-investigator/IncidentResult
      path: schemas/IncidentResult.json
  workflows:
    - id: sre-investigator.triage
      path: workflows/triage.yaml

overlays:
  config:
    - name: pools
      scope: system
      key: pools
      strategy: json_merge_patch
      path: overlays/pools.patch.yaml
    - name: timeouts
      scope: system
      key: timeouts
      strategy: json_merge_patch
      path: overlays/timeouts.patch.yaml
  policy:
    - name: safety
      strategy: bundle_fragment
      path: overlays/policy.fragment.yaml

tests:
  policySimulations:
    - name: allow_collect
      request:
        tenantId: default
        topic: job.sre-investigator.collect.k8s
        capability: sre.collect.k8s
        riskTags: ["network"]
      expectDecision: ALLOW
```

### Topic schema bindings

Topic entries may bind request/response schemas directly in the manifest:

```yaml
topics:
  - name: job.my-pack.action
    inputSchema: my-pack/ActionInput
    outputSchema: my-pack/ActionResult
```

Rules:

- `inputSchema` and `outputSchema` are optional, but when set they must reference IDs
  declared under `resources.schemas`.
- At install time these fields are copied into the canonical topic registry as
  `input_schema_id` / `output_schema_id`.
- The gateway uses the input binding for submit-time validation, and the scheduler uses
  the same registry metadata during pre-dispatch schema enforcement.
- Packs that omit schema bindings remain valid; the topic is still registered, just
  without schema-backed validation.

## Naming rules (enforced by installer)

- Pack ID: `^[a-z0-9-]+$`
- Topics: `job.<pack_id>.*`
- Workflow IDs: `<pack_id>.<name>`
- Schema IDs: `<pack_id>/<name>`
- Pool names **created by the pack** must start with `<pack_id>`. Packs may map topics to pre-existing pools.

## Install flow

`cordumctl pack install <path|url>` performs:

0) Acquire locks: `packs:global` + `pack:<id>` (single-writer semantics).
1) Validate `pack.yaml` (namespacing, protocol version).
2) Collision checks:
   - Schema/workflow id exists + different digest -> fail unless `--upgrade`.
3) Register schemas.
4) Upsert workflows.
5) Apply config overlays (json merge patch) into config service.
6) Apply policy fragments into config service bundle.
7) Register manifest topics in the canonical topic registry (`cfg:system:topics`).
8) Write pack registry record to `cfg:system:packs`.

### Atomicity + rollback (best-effort)

If any step after writes begin fails, the installer attempts to roll back:
- delete any topic registrations created in this attempt
- revert config overlays to the previous snapshot
- restore previous policy fragment values (or delete if newly added)
- delete schemas/workflows created in this attempt; restore previous versions when upgrading

### Policy fragments

Policy fragments are stored in `cfg:system:policy` under `bundles`:

```
cfg:system:policy.data.bundles["<pack_id>/<name>"] = {
  content: "<yaml>",
  version: "<pack_version>",
  sha256: "<digest>",
  installed_at: "<rfc3339>"
}
```

Pack policy fragments must never be written to `cfg:system:default`. Gateway
startup migrates any legacy `system/default.data.bundles` entries into
`cfg:system:policy`, and config writes targeting `system/default` reject a
top-level `bundles` key to prevent future scope corruption.

Safety kernel merges file/URL policy with config service fragments on load/reload.
Snapshot hashes are combined (e.g. `baseSnapshot|cfg:<hash>`).

When a pack installs or updates a policy fragment, the installer publishes a NATS
notification on `sys.config.changed` to signal the safety kernel. The kernel
picks up the new fragment and reloads policy immediately — no service restart
required.

Policy rules may include **remediations** to suggest safer alternatives:

```yaml
rules:
  - id: deny-prod-delete
    match:
      topics: ["job.db.delete"]
    decision: deny
    reason: "Production deletes are blocked"
    remediations:
      - id: archive
        title: "Archive instead of delete"
        summary: "Route to a retention-safe workflow"
        replacement_topic: "job.db.archive"
        replacement_capability: "db.archive"
        add_labels:
          reason: "policy_remediation"
```

Remediations are surfaced on job detail and can be applied via `POST /api/v1/jobs/{id}/remediate`.

Bundle entries may also include `enabled`, `author`, `message`, `created_at`, and `updated_at` (Policy Studio uses these).
When omitted, bundles default to enabled.

Related env vars:
- `SAFETY_POLICY_CONFIG_SCOPE` (default `system`)
- `SAFETY_POLICY_CONFIG_ID` (default `policy`)
- `SAFETY_POLICY_CONFIG_KEY` (default `bundles`)
- `SAFETY_POLICY_CONFIG_DISABLE=1` to disable config service fragments
- `SAFETY_POLICY_RELOAD_INTERVAL` (duration, default 30s)

### Config overlays

Config overlays use **json_merge_patch** semantics:
- `null` deletes a key (used by uninstall).
- Supported top-level keys: `pools`, `timeouts`.

`overlays.config[].key` targets a field inside a config document (`cfg:<scope>:<scope_id>`).
For example, `scope: system` + `scope_id: default` + `key: pools` patches `cfg:system:default.data.pools`.
If `scope_id` is omitted for system scope, the default is `default`.

`pools` patch supports:
- `topics`: map of `topic -> pool(s)`
- `pools`: map of `pool -> {requires: []}`

`timeouts` patch supports:
- `topics`: map of topic-specific timeouts
- `workflows`: map of workflow-specific timeouts

Scheduler reloads `pools` and `timeouts` from config service periodically:
- `SCHEDULER_CONFIG_RELOAD_INTERVAL` (duration, default 30s)

On startup the scheduler bootstraps defaults from `config/pools.yaml` and
`config/timeouts.yaml` into config service if missing.

## Uninstall flow

`cordumctl pack uninstall <id>`:

- Removes pack-owned topic registrations from the canonical topic registry.
- Removes config overlays (merge patch deletion).
- Removes policy fragments.
- Marks pack as `DISABLED` in registry.

`--purge` additionally deletes workflows and schemas that the pack installed.

## Upgrade flow

For upgrades, schemas/workflows are upserted; config and policy overlays replace previous values.
Policy fragment keys are stable per pack+name so upgrades overwrite in place.

## CLI commands

```bash
cordumctl pack install ./my-pack
cordumctl pack install https://example.com/my-pack.tgz
cordumctl pack install --inactive ./my-pack
cordumctl pack install --upgrade ./my-pack
cordumctl pack list
cordumctl pack show sre-investigator
cordumctl pack verify sre-investigator
cordumctl pack uninstall sre-investigator
cordumctl pack uninstall --purge sre-investigator
```

Flags:
- `--inactive` installs workflows/schemas but skips pool mappings (pack is INACTIVE).
- `--upgrade` overwrites existing schemas/workflows if digest differs.
- `--force` bypasses `minCoreVersion` validation.
- `--dry-run` prints intent without writing.

## Pack registry

Installed packs are recorded in config service:

```
cfg:system:packs.data.installed["<pack_id>"] = {
  id, version, status, installed_at, resources, overlays, tests, ...
}
```

## How packs use workflow step metadata

Workflows can attach `meta` to steps to pass job metadata:
`pack_id`, `capability`, `risk_tags`, `requires`, `actor_id`, `idempotency_key`.
This maps directly to CAP `JobMetadata` during dispatch.

## Compatibility

- `compatibility.protocolVersion` must match the CAP wire protocol (currently `1`).
- `minCoreVersion` is enforced when the gateway build version is a valid semver.
  Dev/unknown builds skip the check; `--force` always bypasses it.
- Gateway build version is read from `GET /api/v1/status` (`build.version`); include `X-API-Key` and `X-Tenant-ID` when auth is enabled.

## Pack Development Workflow

Full lifecycle for creating, testing, and publishing a pack:

```
create → develop → test → build → verify → publish
```

### 1. Scaffold

```bash
cordumctl pack create my-pack
cd my-pack/
```

This generates a skeleton with `pack.yaml`, `workflows/`, `schemas/`, and `overlays/` directories.

### 2. Develop

Add your worker code, workflow definitions, schemas, and policy fragments. Follow the [naming rules](#naming-rules-enforced-by-installer) — topics must match `job.<pack_id>.*`.

### 3. Test Locally

Install the pack against a local Cordum stack:

```bash
# Start infrastructure
export CORDUM_API_KEY="$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
docker compose up -d

# Install pack (dry run first)
cordumctl pack install --dry-run ./my-pack
cordumctl pack install ./my-pack

# Verify pack is installed
cordumctl pack list
cordumctl pack show my-pack
```

### 4. Verify

```bash
cordumctl pack verify my-pack
```

### 5. Build Archive

```bash
tar -czf my-pack.tgz -C my-pack .
sha256sum my-pack.tgz
```

### 6. Publish

See [Marketplace Publishing](#marketplace-publishing) below.

---

## Pack Verification

`cordumctl pack verify <id>` runs the policy simulation tests defined in the
installed pack's `tests.policySimulations` section against the live safety kernel.

How it works:

1. Fetches the pack record from `cfg:system:packs`.
2. For each `policySimulations` entry, sends a `POST /api/v1/policy/simulate` request with the test's topic, capability, risk tags, and other metadata.
3. Compares the returned decision against `expectDecision` (normalized — e.g. `ALLOW`, `DENY`, `REQUIRE_APPROVAL`, `THROTTLE`, `ALLOW_WITH_CONSTRAINTS`).
4. If `pack_id` is not set in the test request, it defaults to the pack's own ID.
5. If `tenantId` is not set, it defaults to `default`.
6. Exits with an error on the first failing simulation.

Schema validation, naming rules, and compatibility checks are performed during
`pack install`, not during `pack verify`.

### Simulation request fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `tenantId` | Tenant to simulate against (default: `default`) |
| `topic` | NATS topic (e.g. `job.my-pack.echo`) |
| `capability` | Capability string (e.g. `my-pack.echo`) |
| `riskTags` | Risk tag list (e.g. `["network", "write"]`) |
| `requires` | Requirements list (e.g. `["kubectl"]`) |
| `packId` | Pack ID override (defaults to the installed pack ID) |
| `actorId` | Actor identifier for the simulation |
| `actorType` | Actor type (`user`, `service`, etc.) |

Example `pack.yaml` test block:

```yaml
tests:
  policySimulations:
    - name: allow_echo
      request:
        tenantId: default
        topic: job.hello-pack.echo
        capability: hello.echo
      expectDecision: ALLOW
    - name: deny_dangerous
      request:
        topic: job.hello-pack.exec
        capability: exec.shell
        riskTags: ["shell_exec"]
      expectDecision: DENY
```

```bash
$ cordumctl pack verify my-pack
pack my-pack policy simulations passed
```

---

## Testing Packs

### Unit Testing Handlers

Since pack handlers are typed Go functions (`func(runtime.Context, TIn) (TOut, error)`),
you can test them directly without NATS or Redis:

```go
func TestEchoHandler(t *testing.T) {
    input := echoInput{Message: "test", Author: "bot"}
    output, err := handler(runtime.Context{}, input)
    if err != nil {
        t.Fatal(err)
    }
    if output.Message != "test" {
        t.Fatalf("expected 'test', got %q", output.Message)
    }
}
```

### Integration Testing with Docker Compose

Add a `deploy/docker-compose.yaml` to your pack for local testing:

```yaml
services:
  my-worker:
    build: .
    environment:
      - NATS_URL=nats://nats:4222
      - REDIS_URL=redis://:$REDIS_PASSWORD@redis:6379
      - WORKER_ID=my-worker
    depends_on:
      nats:
        condition: service_healthy
    networks:
      - cordum_default

networks:
  cordum_default:
    external: true
```

Run against the main Cordum stack:

```bash
# Start Cordum stack
docker compose up -d

# Start your pack worker (joins the Cordum network)
docker compose -f my-pack/deploy/docker-compose.yaml up -d

# Submit a test job
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/jobs \
  -H "X-API-Key: $CORDUM_API_KEY" \
  -H "X-Tenant-ID: default" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt":"hello","topic":"job.my-pack.echo"}'
```

### E2E Smoke Test Pattern

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

# Install pack
cordumctl pack install ./my-pack

# Submit job and capture ID
JOB_ID=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/jobs \
  -H "X-API-Key: $CORDUM_API_KEY" \
  -H "X-Tenant-ID: default" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt":"smoke test","topic":"job.my-pack.echo"}' | jq -r '.id')

# Poll for completion (max 30s)
for i in $(seq 1 30); do
  STATUS=$(curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/v1/jobs/$JOB_ID \
    -H "X-API-Key: $CORDUM_API_KEY" \
    -H "X-Tenant-ID: default" | jq -r '.status')
  [ "$STATUS" = "succeeded" ] && echo "PASS" && exit 0
  [ "$STATUS" = "failed" ] && echo "FAIL" && exit 1
  sleep 1
done
echo "TIMEOUT" && exit 1
```

### Policy Simulation Tests

Built into `pack.yaml` under `tests.policySimulations`. Run them with:

```bash
cordumctl pack verify my-pack
```

This evaluates each simulation against the live safety kernel and reports pass/fail.

---

## Pack Configuration

### Declaring Required Config

Packs declare configuration requirements through config overlays. The `overlays.config` section in `pack.yaml` specifies patches applied to the config service:

```yaml
overlays:
  config:
    - name: pools
      scope: system
      key: pools
      strategy: json_merge_patch
      path: overlays/pools.patch.yaml
```

### Config Patch Format

Pool mapping patch (`overlays/pools.patch.yaml`):

```yaml
topics:
  job.my-pack.analyze: my-pack
  job.my-pack.summarize: my-pack
pools:
  my-pack:
    requires: ["network:egress"]
```

Timeout patch (`overlays/timeouts.patch.yaml`):

```yaml
topics:
  job.my-pack.analyze:
    dispatch_timeout: 30s
    execution_timeout: 120s
```

### Default Values

Config patches use JSON Merge Patch semantics — values are set if not already present, and `null` removes a key. The scheduler reloads config periodically (`SCHEDULER_CONFIG_RELOAD_INTERVAL`, default 30s).

### Pool Config Caching

The scheduler's `bootstrapConfig()` is write-once — it caches pool config in Redis key `cfg:system:default`. If your pack's pool mapping isn't picked up after install:

```bash
# Delete the cached config key
docker compose exec redis redis-cli -a "$REDIS_PASSWORD" DEL cfg:system:default
docker compose restart scheduler
```

See [DOCKER.md](/getting-started/docker) for more on this caching behavior.

---

## Worker Registration

Pack workers must register with the platform via heartbeats and topic subscriptions.

### Runtime Lifecycle

Using the Go SDK (`sdk/runtime`):

```go
import (
    "github.com/cordum/cordum/sdk/runtime"
    "github.com/nats-io/nats.go"
)

// 1. Create an agent
agent := &runtime.Agent{
    NATSURL:  "nats://nats:4222",
    RedisURL: "redis://:$REDIS_PASSWORD@redis:6379",
    SenderID: "my-worker",
}

// 2. Register handlers for pack topics
runtime.Register(agent, "job.my-pack.analyze", analyzeHandler)
runtime.Register(agent, "job.my-pack.summarize", summarizeHandler)
// Direct-address handler (for targeted dispatch)
runtime.Register(agent, runtime.DirectSubject("my-worker"), analyzeHandler)

// 3. Start the agent (subscribes to NATS topics)
agent.Start()
defer agent.Close()

// 4. Start heartbeat loop
nc, _ := nats.Connect("nats://nats:4222")
heartbeatFn := func() ([]byte, error) {
    return runtime.HeartbeatPayload(
        "my-worker",   // worker ID
        "my-pack",     // pool name (must match pools.yaml mapping)
        0,             // active jobs
        4,             // max concurrent jobs
        0,             // reserved
    )
}
go runtime.HeartbeatLoop(ctx, nc, heartbeatFn)
```

### Heartbeat Protocol

Workers emit heartbeats on `sys.heartbeat` every 5 seconds (default). The scheduler uses these to:

1. **Track worker liveness** — workers missing 3+ heartbeats are marked offline
2. **Route jobs** — only workers in the matching pool with available capacity receive jobs
3. **Monitor capacity** — `active_jobs` / `max_concurrent` drives the dashboard's agent fleet view

**Critical**: The pool name in `HeartbeatPayload` must match the pool that the pack's topic maps to in `config/pools.yaml` (or the pack's pool overlay).

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `NATS_URL` | `nats://127.0.0.1:4222` | NATS connection URL |
| `REDIS_URL` | `redis://:$REDIS_PASSWORD@127.0.0.1:6379/0` | Redis connection URL |
| `WORKER_ID` | *(required)* | Unique worker identifier |

See [sdk-reference.md](/api-reference/sdk-reference) for the full SDK API reference.

---

## Marketplace Publishing

### Publishing Flow

1. **Prepare**: Ensure `pack.yaml` is complete with `metadata.image`, `compatibility`, and `tests`
2. **Build**: Create a `.tgz` archive: `tar -czf my-pack-0.1.0.tgz -C my-pack .`
3. **Compute digest**: `sha256sum my-pack-0.1.0.tgz`
4. **Host**: Upload the `.tgz` to a publicly accessible URL
5. **Register**: Add an entry to your catalog JSON:

```json
{
  "id": "my-pack",
  "title": "My Pack",
  "description": "Does something useful",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "url": "https://example.com/packs/my-pack-0.1.0.tgz",
  "sha256": "<digest>",
  "image": "https://example.com/my-pack-icon.svg",
  "tags": ["sre", "monitoring"]
}
```

### Official Catalog

The official pack catalog lives at `https://github.com/cordum-io/cordum-packs` and is published to `https://packs.cordum.io/catalog.json`. To submit:

1. Fork `cordum-packs`
2. Add your pack under `packs/<pack-id>/`
3. Update `catalog.json` with your entry
4. Open a pull request

### Version Management

- Pack versions follow semver (`major.minor.patch`)
- The marketplace shows the latest version per pack
- Users can install specific versions via `"version": "0.3.1"` in the install payload
- Old versions remain available at their URLs

### Unpublishing

Remove the entry from the catalog JSON and re-publish. Installed instances are not affected — unpublishing only prevents new installs.
