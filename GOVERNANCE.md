# Cordum Governance

## Project Overview

Cordum is a deterministic control plane for autonomous workflows with governance built in. This document outlines how the project is governed, how decisions are made, and how contributors can participate.

## Protocol Stability Pledge

Cordum commits to **wire-format stability** for enterprise adopters:

- **CAP v2 protobuf schemas** (`BusPacket`, `JobRequest`, `JobResult`, `Heartbeat`) are **frozen until February 2027**. No breaking changes to field numbers, field types, or required fields. New fields may be added as `optional`.
- **Safety Kernel evaluation API** (`POST /api/v1/policy/evaluate` request/response shape) is frozen for the same period.
- **Gateway REST API** endpoints documented in the [API reference](https://docs.cordum.io/api) will not have breaking changes within a major version.

### Deprecation Policy

Any deprecated API receives **2 minor versions** of deprecation warnings before removal:

1. **Minor N**: Feature marked deprecated in docs, logs emit warnings
2. **Minor N+1**: Deprecation warnings become errors in strict mode
3. **Minor N+2**: Feature removed

### Versioning

Cordum follows **Semantic Versioning** (semver):

| Bump | Meaning | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Major** | Breaking API or wire-format changes | `1.0.0` → `2.0.0` |
| **Minor** | New features, backward-compatible | `1.0.0` → `1.1.0` |
| **Patch** | Bug fixes, security patches | `1.0.0` → `1.0.1` |

### Release Cadence

- **Patch releases**: Monthly (or immediately for critical security fixes)
- **Minor releases**: Quarterly
- **Major releases**: Annually, with 6-month migration window

## Project Structure


**Advisors:**

| Handle | Focus |
|--------|-------|
| *Open — accepting advisor applications* | Security, Protocol Design, Enterprise Integrations |

To apply as an advisor, open an issue with the `governance` label or email governance@cordum.io.

### Contributors

Anyone can contribute to Cordum. Contributors include:
- Code contributors (features, bug fixes)
- Documentation contributors
- Community managers (forums, Discord, issues)
- Security researchers

## Decision-Making Process

### Consensus Model

Cordum follows a **lazy consensus** model:

1. **Proposal:** Contributor proposes a change (PR, RFC, issue discussion)
2. **Review period:** Minimum 72 hours for community feedback
3. **Consensus:** If no objections from core maintainers → approved
4. **Escalation:** If disagreement → escalate to Project Lead

### Major Decisions

Major changes require explicit approval:

- **Architecture changes** (new components, protocols)
- **Breaking API changes** (major version bumps)
- **License changes** (requires unanimous consent)
- **Security policies** (vetted by security team)

**Process:**
1. Author submits RFC (Request for Comments) as GitHub issue
2. Community discussion (minimum 2 weeks)
3. Core team vote (majority required)
4. Project Lead final approval

### Day-to-Day Decisions

Minor changes (bug fixes, docs, small features) follow normal PR process:

1. Submit PR with clear description
2. Automated CI checks pass
3. 2+ approvals from maintainers
4. Merge

## Contribution Guidelines

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed guidelines.

### Code Review Standards

All code must be reviewed:

- **1 approval:** Documentation, tests, small bug fixes
- **2 approvals:** New features, refactors
- **3 approvals:** Architecture changes, security-sensitive code

Reviewers check for:
- ✅ Correctness and test coverage
- ✅ Performance implications
- ✅ Security considerations
- ✅ Documentation updates
- ✅ Backward compatibility
